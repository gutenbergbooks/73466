<p><span class="sc">20th January</span>.—The vessels were towed
further to the southward by the Libàhn, whilst the commanders, and
we Franks with them, walked on the magnificent shore. The wind,
with which, however, we had previously sailed, although not quicker
than the pace we walked at on shore, freshened at ten o’clock, and
we repaired again on board the vessels. I had made a real forced
march, and was at last compelled to be carried, owing to increasing
weakness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2_v2">[2]</span> Little
villages and isolated tokuls stood in the beautiful woody country,
which is interspersed with solitary light spaces or corn-fields,
where, however, the short fine grass was withered. These tokuls are
elevated above the ground on stakes, and serve to protect the
fruits, or as sleeping-places for security against noxious animals
or the temporary damp of the soil. The natives dance, sing, and
jump, slide on their knees, sell or exchange their god (glass
beads—Arabic, sug-sug), amongst one another, and squat, but not by
sitting upright in the Turkish manner, and smoke their pipes. These
pipes have prettily-worked black clay bowls, with a tube of reeds,
and a long iron mouthpiece: even the tongs, to apply the charcoal
to light them, are not wanting. They are cheated in the most
shameful manner by the Turco-Arabian people; robbed of their
weapons, and plundered right and left. What am I to do? I am ill,
and have lost my voice; yet I try to prevent these outrages as far
as I am able.</p>

<p>The so-called elephant-tree prevails here exclusively; and one
of the chief amusements this morning was to shoot down its fruit,
in which exploit Suliman Kashef distinguished himself as the best
shot. The shady trees, the prospect on the river, enlivened by the
glittering sails, the blue chain of mountains—it was a sight that
did me good, and refreshed my inmost soul. But all this was again
clouded by Turks. Is there another word for Turks? No:
Turks,—<em>basta!</em> A negro, who came from the other side to
swim over to us, got into the track of the sailing vessels, and was
drowned, although he might have been easily picked up by two ships
following us. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3_v2">[3]</span>
commanders had gone on a-head, and I was behind with the Frenchmen;
I was not able to call, and therefore fired off my gun, in order,
by signs, to induce them to save him. Arnaud also, whose vessel was
just bearing up, might have easily prevented the death of the
unfortunate creature if he had given a hail to his reïs. He even
blamed my impatience, saying I was ill; and added, with the
contemptuous tone, in which the Arab pronounces his “Abit,” and the
Turk his “kiàfr,” “Why do the fellows swim about in the water?”
Upon this I could not forbear using hard words.</p>

<p>An Egyptian soldier, who, like some others of the libàhn, had
remained behind on shore to ransack the deserted tokuls, ran behind
a young naked girl, when I fortunately noticed the circumstance in
our walk. I hastened to Suliman Kashef, who was gallant enough to
recall, with a voice of command, the libertine from this his wicked
purpose.</p>

<p>The Turkish character involuntarily shews itself on such
occasions as these; it goes against his grain to see an inferior
enjoying any pleasure. There was no merit, therefore, in Suliman’s
conduct, even had he warded off from us a Sicilian vespers. Thibaut
had had also a similar incident on board his vessel with the reïs,
who wanted to be too free with a young girl whom the former, during
this voyage, had purchased for a few glass beads,—I believe from
the Keks. This incident was also announced in due form by us; but
they laughed, and said, “Badèn” (afterwards), and Arnaud even
joined in this opinion.</p>

<p>At a quarter past ten o’clock, the north wind has completely
died away, and we tack about towards the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_4_v2">[4]</span> west for a short tract, when it becomes
again so fresh, whilst the wind is S.W., that we are able to sail
slowly. To all appearance, unfortunately, our vaunted voyage of
discovery will soon have an end. Selim-Capitan is frightened to a
ludicrous degree; Arnaud cannot conceal his fear; and Suliman
Kashef, not being yet restored to health, is utterly indifferent. I
cannot refrain from considering an instant return as a disgrace and
as treachery both to the world and Mohammed Ali. On the right an
island, and the last of those two which we had on our left still
continues, and so we are somewhat free from the noise of the people
on the shore. Sale and Sate Mohammed are no longer seen on land;
they have perhaps become the victims of their passions, although
they were only to shoot for me a pair of turtle-doves.</p>

<p>We halt, for a time, on the left shore, where there is a large
village, partly scattered in the wood that skirts the river so
beautifully. At eleven o’clock we set out again, and our men drive
back the cattle from the island close to us, through the water to
the right shore, for their unfathomable throats appear at last to
be satiated. The clapping of hands, keeping time to the singing,
above which the “kih, kih” of the women is heard, accompanies us
from both sides. We cannot hear or see anything for the crowd and
clatter, especially myself, round whom all the beautiful world
floats as in a mist, and a jarring din sings in my ears, so that my
writing, inexorably necessary as it is, becomes exceedingly
difficult. I dared not close my eyes for fear of becoming
completely confused. I wanted to go to Selim Capitan, or rather to
his interpreter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5_v2">[5]</span> but
was not able to put the requisite questions and to note down the
answers. I continue to write mechanically, and cannot square my own
journal, when I try to revise the entries of the last few days; for
everything flickers before my eyes, and my memory is gone, so that
it all appears to me like a dream.</p>

<p>With a light north-east wind, which also assisted us yesterday,
we proceed S.S.W. It is noon, and we have two islands, lying close
to each other, on our left. A large island ends on our right, and
another one begins, by which the course in the middle of the river
is, in some degree, confined. Nevertheless, the river always
retains a considerable breadth, and a proper depth; and then,—will
the poltroons return? The mountain, already several times
mentioned, peeps into the window from the west; it shews itself as
two mountains lying one close to the other, the western of which
rises conically, and has an obtuse peak, and an undulating tail to
the west. The latter appears somewhat wooded, yet these masses
giving light and shade may be mostly blocks; the conically
ascending mountain, on the contrary, has a smooth surface, and may
be an extinguished volcano, although one would not expect to find
such here. We now find, for the first time, stones in the river,
and they are granite and gneiss. They are not yet rounded; the
chain of mountains from whence they come cannot, therefore, be very
far distant. We proceed S.S.W. An island terminates on the left,
and another follows at the distance of some hundred paces.</p>

<p>Four o’clock. S.W. An occurrence has just happened, which might
be the death of us all if<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_6_v2">[6]</span> anything were to be feared from the revenge
of these evidently good-natured people. We were on the right side
of the river, and went to the left, where the little sandal was
towed not far from us by the Libàhn. Natives had stationed
themselves here in large and small groups; they greeted us, held up
their hands, pointed to their necks for beads, and sang, danced,
and jumped. There was no end of laughing in our vessel; I was
attentive to what was going on, and saw that the natives had seized
the rope of the sandal, and would not let it be towed further, for
they wanted beads. Probably the crew of the sandal had taken
weapons or ornaments from them, without giving anything in return,
as this frequently happened. We steered close to the left shore to
assist our men, when eight bold armed figures advanced towards us,
and gave us to understand by pantomimic signs, that we had
presented beads to their neighbours below, but would not give them
anything. They offered the rings on their arms, and their weapons,
and signified to us, as we were advancing libàhn, on account of the
faintness of the wind, that they would not allow us to tow any
further unless we gave them something. They said all this, however,
with a laughing countenance, jumped about, and laughed anew. It was
plain they were only in jest; but our bloodthirsty fellows, seeing
no danger in this small number of men, and never thinking of the
probable consequences, just like the Turks, considered this an
excellent opportunity to display their courage. They seized their
weapons. I was unwell, but yet was standing on deck, and kept order
as well as my weak voice would allow me. I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_7_v2">[7]</span> went from one to the other, and enjoined
them not to fire, until arrows were first shot at them. The black
soldiers, who were mostly recruits, I admonished especially not to
be <em>filles de joie</em> (the usual expression here applied to
those who exhibit fear in discharging their guns), but men (rigàl,
sing. ragel), to grasp the gun firmly, and to take good aim. Our
blacks are generally very much afraid of the report of guns, and do
exactly as the Greeks did at the commencement of their war for
freedom; they lay the butt-end on the thigh, and fire at random. On
the White River, also, the report of these unknown weapons was more
feared than the real danger itself. They listened to me; but then
came the vessel of Captain Mohammed Agà, a fool-hardy Arnaut, who
is always trying to distinguish himself in some way or another. He
shouted to the sandal to cut away the rope, although the men were
still on land. This was about to be done, when the tallest negro,
who had twisted the rope round a little tree, pointed his bow at
the sailor who was about to cut it through with his knife. He
laughed at the same time, and it was clear that he was not in
earnest; for he had wrestled in a friendly manner with the other
sailors, when they tried to get the rope from him, without making
use of his weapons. Yet the Arnaut commanded them to “fire,” whilst
he had already aimed at the incautious native, being the first to
discharge his piece. In a moment all three vessels fired away, as
though they were beset by the devil. I was only able to pull back a
couple of fellows whose guns had flashed in the pan. Eleven or
twelve other victims followed the first, who was knocked over by
the captain’s shot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8_v2">[8]</span>
Those who went away wounded were not counted. An old woman was shot
down by an Egyptian standing near me, and yet he boasted of this
heroic deed, as did all the others of theirs. There might have been
from twenty-five to thirty natives collected together at that
place, scarcely thirty paces from us, and the high-standing straw
might have concealed several more.</p>

<p>We sailed away with the wind favouring our criminal action, for
our men had again come on board before the firing commenced. The
Dahabiës sailing ahead of us must have heard our shots; they did
not however furl <em>one</em> sail to lend us assistance, which
might have been eventually necessary. Before we caught up these
vessels, we saw a woman on the shore, looking about among the dead
men, and then afterwards running to the city at some distance from
the shore. The natives were hastening towards it, but they did not
trust themselves near us. Yet they knew not the melancholy truth
that our shots would hit at a distance; hitherto they feared only
the thunder and lightning of them, as we had seen several times. We
halted a moment; the unhappy creatures or relatives of the slain
came closer to the border of the shore, laid their hands flat
together, raised them above their head, slid upon their knees
nearer to us, and sprang again high in the air, with their
compressed hands stretched aloft, as if to invoke the pity of
heaven, and to implore mercy of us. A slim young man was so
conspicuous by his passionate grief, that it cut to my heart,
and—our barbarians laughed with all their might. This unbounded
attachment to one another, and the circumstance that that woman, in
spite of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9_v2">[9]</span> danger
so close at hand, sought for the man of her heart among those who
had perished, affected me exceedingly, because such moral intrinsic
worth, flowing from pure natural hearts, is unfortunately more
acquired than innate in civilised nations. We had only advanced a
little on our way, and above thirty unarmed natives, who must yet
at all events have been informed of the tragical incident that had
just occurred, sat down on the sand directly close to the river,
without suspicion, or designing any harm to us, as if nothing had
taken place, and really—I had enough to do to prevent their being
shot at.</p>

<p>We reached the vessels of the commanders, and Mohammed Agà was
the first to hasten to them, in order to report the incident. But I
also drew near, and there was a kind of court martial summoned.
Arnaud did honour to the European name, and took the part of the
Turks, who looked upon the whole as a trifle. Finally, the Arnaut,
who had already confessed the fact, faced about boldly and swift as
lightning, declaring that he had never fired a shot, and that he
would bring witnesses to prove it, and—here the matter ended. Selim
Capitan thought he shewed his wish to keep up a good understanding
with the natives, by throwing into the grass on the shore some
miserable bits of glass paste, with a cup. The natives looked and
groped about, whilst we sailed to the neighbouring island. Here we
found two divisions of negroes, whose chiefs were also presented
with strings of beads. Again we threw beads among the grass, and
ordered the whole occurrence to be explained by the interpreters;
more beads, and—every one jumped forward delighted. One of these
chiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10_v2">[10]</span> had all his
naked body streaked over with ochre: he looked like the black
huntsman of Bohemia. They are said to do this in particular when
they marry; we have seen already several such red men; even the
hair and the ivory bracelets which are thick and of a hand’s
breadth, as well as the numerous iron rings on the wrists and
ankles, are coloured red in this fashion. Rage and vexation,
together with the heat of the sun, compelled me to be carried back
quite exhausted down the shore to the vessel.</p>

<p>Thibaut and Sabatier disclosed to me, as usual, their vexation
at Arnaud’s assuming conduct, and how they are cut up and
calumniated in his journal, which they secretly read, without being
able to call him to account for it at the moment. So likewise I am
obliged to listen to the loud lamentations of his servant Mustaphà,
a Maltese renegade, who always ends with “Credo che sia mezzo matto
quest gran signore o baron fututto.” Although he looks very fierce,
yet he cannot renounce his nature as a tailor, and is continually
asking me whether we are in any danger and begs me, for the holy
Madonna’s sake, to take care that we return as speedily as
possible, for he would rather a thousand times live with his devil
of a wife, than venture again so far among the heathens. Arnaud is
jealous at Suliman Kashef having purchased a young girl with his
beads, and by the assistance of Duschoïl, the interpreter, prettier
than his little sailor’s trull, whom he has hung with glass beads
from head to foot. In a fit of madness he writes a long French
letter to the Kashef, summoning him to restore the girl
immediately, although we are already a long way from her people.
Thibaut translates the letter, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_11_v2">[11]</span> looks as if he had fallen from the clouds,
for he is in the very same boat with Arnaud himself, respecting the
purchase of a girl, that he is going to make a living present to
his black Sara, whom he brought back from England to Khartùm. After
the letter was read aloud, a rude burst of laughter naturally
ensued, and Suliman Kashef said when it was finished, in a pitying
tone of voice, “El shems, el shems!” (the sun, the sun.) Certainly
it is not the first time that the African sun has produced such an
effect on Arnaud; he suffers like all of us, and his arrogance and
pride shake him more violently, because they find opposition on
every side.</p>

<p><em>21st January.</em> I this morning felt myself uncommonly
well but had scarcely stepped out of the door to go ashore, when
the stream of light—I know not what other name to give it—rushed
upon me with such force, and penetrated, as it were, through me,
that I was scarcely able to sink back on my bed; and it is only
now, when, however, the sun is at its height, that I feel myself at
all capable of writing. We have remained since early this morning,
in a southerly direction. The sails have been twice hoisted, but on
the average we are towed by the rope. We leave an island on our
right. There are several red skins among the negroes, who are
really handsome men; the tokuls, standing singly, are large, well
roofed, and, resting upon strong stakes, open on all sides. The
stakes form a peristyle, and the inner wall is smeared inside with
clay; perhaps they serve as stables for cattle, and summer tokuls.
A small gohr, or river, in the neighbourhood of which we repose at
noon, comes merrily in from the right shore,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_12_v2">[12]</span> and the stream has a noble breadth, but
little depth of water.</p>

<p>Two o’clock, S.W. We have a slight north wind, and an island on
our right; behind it, the forest continues on the shore. The high
mountainous district beyond it is still blue, for the day is not
clear. It appears, indeed, partly covered with wood, and to form a
chain with the other mountains. The information we possess about
this region is still very scanty, and it would be difficult to make
any thing out of the interpreters, even if my head were less
affected. Groups of a hundred and fifty to two hundred negroes are
standing together on all sides; they generally accompany us a short
way, without uniting themselves to the next swarm. This perhaps
arises more from accident than for the purpose of keeping their
boundary stations on the water, to prevent falling together by the
ears, whilst watering their herds, and on other occasions. Islands
impede our course, and the crew see, to their terror, a number of
natives, holding their weapons aloft, wade through the river from
one side to the other. We immediately take possession of a little
islet in the middle of the river, and surround it with our vessels;
a regular military position, for it is surrounded with deeper
water. It is about a hundred paces long from north to south, and
from five to six broad, and the shores fall away steeply to the
river.</p>

<p>Feïzulla Capitan disembarks, and returns soon from Selim
Capitan, with the melancholy intelligence that there is “moje
mafish,” (no water). I was completely in despair, left the vessel,
and set off to the top of the islet, where Turks and Franks
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13_v2">[13]</span> assembled for
further consultation. The black people found on it were driven away
by us; they jumped into the water like frogs, so that we heard a
simultaneous fearful splash. They soon stood on the more shallow
ground, and shouted their huzza, “Hui, ii hui iih!” laughed and
joked, and offered their valuables, &amp;c. We let some of the
negroes come on the islet, and gave them presents of beads. About
evening a large herd of cows appeared on the right shore; they were
lean, possibly having been long in want of fresh grass. The men,
armed with spears, bows, and arrows, drove the herds from the right
to the left shore, where we likewise remarked a herd of cattle. Our
gentlemen were horribly afraid when the people accumulated like a
black swarm of bees on all sides.</p>

<p>It was a lucky circumstance that a large bird of prey perched on
the mast, to take a view aloft of the flesh under him. All eyes
were directed to us and this bird, when Suliman Kashef seized his
long gun; the blacks watched us closely, jostled each other, and
were on tenter-hooks of anxiety, for they did not know what it
meant. Suliman Kashef fired; the report set them in momentary fear,
and they were about to run away, when the sight of the bird falling
into the water, noted them, as it were, to the ground. When,
however, other birds of prey flew down on the water, to see what
fate had befallen their feathered friend, the “Hui, ii hui iih,”
immediately came to a close; they ran as fast as they could, for
this appeared too much for them to stand, having seen no arrow or
stone flying at the bird. This single shot might be of importance
at this moment, when the people generally, though at a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_14_v2">[14]</span> distance, might have shewn a
bad feeling; moreover the incident was of inestimable value to the
expedition, because it infused the feeling of our superiority, and
even enhanced it, in their dismayed hearts. If I had previously
strained every nerve to prevent the return already determined upon,
and had got the again-convalescent Kashef on my side, so now even
the timorous Selim Capitan was inclined to have the track more
accurately examined.</p>

<p><em>22nd January.</em>—There was not a breath of wind, and it is
still undetermined whether we shall proceed further. I therefore
proposed to the Frenchmen, whose courage I could naturally have no
doubt of, to take out some of the freight from their vessel, which
is lightly built and convenient, and thus to press on further. They
agreed to this proposal. I described the country, and we were
having breakfast together, when intelligence was brought to us that
it was decided to go on. No sooner does Selim Capitan see the
long-legged blacks going to their cattle, swimming over to the
right shore, than fear seizes him anew; we, however, by our joint
efforts, manage to remove it.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the chief of this country comes to us with his
grown-up son. A red cloth dress of honour is put on the old man; a
red chequered cotton handkerchief tied round his head; and glass
beads are hung round his neck. They also gave the son beads, and
bound a piece of calico round him like a napkin. It was plain to be
seen that they were delighted with these presents, and particularly
at the pleasure of conversing and communicating with us. The old
man’s name is <em>Nalewadtshòhn</em>, his son’s<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_15_v2">[15]</span> <em>Alumbèh</em>; but their
great <em>Mattà</em> (king or lord, perhaps analogous to the title
of honour previously conferred on us, “<em>Màdam</em>,)” is called
Làkono. The latter is said to possess a beautiful red woollen
dress, of a different cut to the Abbaie, presented to
Nalewadtshòhn. It must be truly interesting to see here, all of a
sudden, a negro king in an English uniform, although it may only
come from the Ethiopian sea, or the Indian Ocean. Sultan Làkono
dwells on Mount Pelenja, and rules over a large country, called
Bari, pronounced by the Turks, however, without further ceremony,
Beri. We are said to have been within the limits of this kingdom
for the last two days: those men shot by us belonged also to
Bari.</p>

<p>According to Nalewadtshòhn, who is in general very talkative,
and does not appear very favourably inclined towards his king, all
the mountains in the neighbourhood have abundance of iron; and
Mount Pelenja, a quantity of copper, which is here in great
estimation. Iron-ochre, which the natives here and there use to
colour themselves with, is said to be found on all sides, formed by
them, however, into balls: by this preparation, perhaps, a
cleansing of the material takes place. The high mountain-chain we
had already seen, lies to the west, at some hours’ distance, over
the left shore of the Nile. Its name is Niakanja, and the mountains
before us are called Korèk and Lubèhk, which are said to be
followed by many other higher mountains. Both the men are
strikingly handsome, although not one of the whole multitude can be
called ugly. They are tall and strongly built; have a nose,
somewhat broad indeed, but not flat; on the contrary, slightly
raised, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16_v2">[16]</span> we
see in the heads of Rhamses; a full mouth, not at all like that of
negroes, but exactly the same as in the Egyptian statues; a broad
arched forehead, and a speaking, honest-looking eye. The latter is
not, as we have found generally in the marsh regions, entirely
suffused with blood, whereby the countenances have a dismal
appearance, but clear, full, and black, yet not dazzling. We
observed that their legs were well formed, though not muscular;
their naked bodies were adorned with the very same decorations of
ivory and iron as we had seen in the others. The name of the
village on the right side of the river is Baràko; the village lying
immediately opposite, under the trees, before which are a small
island and pastures, is called Niowàh. Alumbèh was sent as our
envoy to King Làkono.</p>

<p>We leave our island at noon, and have a larger island on our
right, a smaller one on the left, and tow to the south, accompanied
by the negroes in the water: they even come with their long bodies
to the side of the vessel, and part with every thing they have for
the beloved sug-sug.</p>

<p>At Asser (three o’clock in the afternoon), S.S.W., with oars and
sails. A village, on the right side of the river, contains only a
few tokuls; but a large herd of cattle, grazing there, sets our
crew longing again. About sun-set, S. I procure a beautiful spear
for a single glass bead—silly, childish people! Immediately after
sun-set, W.S.W. On the left a small island; a gohr, or arm of a
river, appearing to form a large island, pours forth from thence,
if it be not a tributary stream. The wood before us contrasts by
its dark hue with the coloured horizon, over which,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_17_v2">[17]</span> as yet, no alpine country
glows. On the right shore stand a number of armed and laughing
negroes, in picturesque positions; this has been the case the whole
time, both in the water and on land. They walk arm-in-arm, quite in
a brotherly manner, or with their arms round one another’s necks,
as the students in Germany used to do in my time. They help each
other in getting up on shore, and have frequently one foot placed
firmly against the knee, standing like cranes. They lean on their
spears, or long bows, or squat down; but I see none of them sitting
or lying on the ground, according to the lazy custom of the
orientals.</p>

<p>The north wind is so faint that we are obliged to lend
assistance with poles; the river has more water, thank God, than we
thought; and even our reïs, whom a longing fit for his wives every
now and then seizes, believes that this water-course will hold on
for some time. We anchor in the middle of the river, and the guards
are doubled in the vessels. I am tired of this constant variety of
sensations, and yet would like to see and hear much more. My head
is so heavy and stupid, that I cannot accept Suliman Kashef’s
invitation.</p>

<p><em>23rd January.</em>—Half-past eight o’clock. We have gone so
far in a southerly direction by the rope, and we move S. by W. and
S.W. The rapidity of the river has increased from one mile and a
half to two miles. The walk on shore has tired me more, because I
was followed by the natives, with all their effects, and retarded,
so that I was obliged to break a road through them, half by
violence, though I am still very weak in my legs. I purchased for a
couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18_v2">[18]</span> of
miserable beads a little sheep, covered partly with wool, and
partly with hair, as the sheep here generally are, and having a
long mane under the throat, and horns twisted back. Selim Capitan
says that a similar species is found in Crete.</p>

<p>Tobacco is called here also tabac, as mostly on the White River.
The Arabs give it the name of dogàhn; this is the small-leaved
sort, with dun-coloured flowers, which is cultivated likewise in
Bellet Sudàn. I have not seen the tobacco-plant growing wild here;
therefore, I cannot say whether the name of tobacco is indigenous
here with the plant, or has been introduced by immigrants.
Nevertheless, the Arabs are not generally smokers, and it is
unlikely that tobacco was brought in by them; and it is less
probable, because, had it been so, it would have kept the name of
dogàhn. In Sennaar, however, a good but very strong tobacco has
been cultivated for ages, and was probably introduced by the
Funghs, who are likewise a well-formed negro race. Our usual title
of honour is matta, which they, however, only give to the whites.
The shores are very extensively intersected with layers of
sand.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock. S. by E., and then S.W. Two villages on the right
shore. We sail with a slight north wind, but scarcely make one
mile, for the current is considerably against us. We meet
continually with some fire-eaters among the blacks on the shore;
they are startled, certainly, at the report, but are not
particularly frightened, especially if it be not close to their
ears. We have Mount Korèk in a south-westerly direction before us.
It stands like the Niakanja, to which we have only come within
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19_v2">[19]</span> distance of
from three to four hours, and which lies behind us, isolated from
the other mountains. The summit appears flat from where we are; it
has many indentations, and seems to rise only about six hundred
feet above its broad basis, to which the ground ascends from the
river. The wind having nearly ceased for half an hour, freshens
again for three miles.</p>

<p>At noon. S.S.W. In a quarter of an hour, a gohr or arm of the
Nile comes from S. by E.; we make only two miles more, and the wind
deserts us again; we lie, therefore, as if stuck to the place,
after having been thrown by the current on to the island, formed by
the before-named arm on the right shore. But the wind soon freshens
again; we sail away cheerfully. The ships drive one against the
other, or upon the sand, but work themselves loose again; the
negroes come in the water; confusion here—confusion everywhere. A
herd of calves stop in the water before us; this is really
tempting, but we sail on. The log gives four miles, from which two
miles must be deducted for the rapidity of the current, though the
reïs can not understand this.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve o’clock, the end of the island; we sail
S.S.E., and then S. by W. On the right shore a large durra-field,
apparently the second crop on the very same stalks. The natives
there, according to the custom of this country, have little stools
to sit on, and a small gourd drinking-cup by their side. As before,
part of them are unarmed, and have merely a long stick, with forks
or horns at the top, in their hands. The covering of the head is
various. Several have differently formed little wicker
baskets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20_v2">[20]</span> on their
heads, as a protection against the sun. They wear strings of the
teeth of dogs or apes on various parts of the body, but mostly on
the neck, as an ornament or talisman. They have bracelets, the
points of which being covered with bits of fur, are curved outwards
like little horns. Our envoy Alumbèh imitated all the motions and
the voice of an ox, in order to make us understand the meaning of
these bracelets. These, as well as the forks on their houses and
sticks, appear to denote in some way a kind of symbolic veneration
for the bull, whose horns I had previously seen adorned with
animals’ tails; for the bull is bold, and the support of the family
among the herds.</p>

<p>One o’clock. A number of negroes are squatting on the island at
the left, or rather are sitting on their stools, and wondering at
us sailing so merrily to S.S.W. I count eleven villages; but I do
not trust myself on deck, for we have 30° Reaumur. About evening
the whole scene will appear more surprising and pleasing to me; for
even my servants, looking in exultingly at the window, praise the
beauty of the country. On all sides, therefore, plenty of
mountains, stones, and rocks; the great buildings in the interior
of Africa are no longer a fable to me! If the nation of Bari has
had internal strength enough to pursue the road of cultivation for
thousands of years, what has prevented it not only from rising from
its natural state, but also from appropriating to itself the higher
European cultivation? It has a stream, navigable, and bringing
fertility, full of eatable animals; a magnificent land affording it
everything: it has to sustain war with the gigantic monsters of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21_v2">[21]</span> land and
water, and to combat with its own kind; it possesses the best of
all metals, iron, from which it understands how to form very
handsome weapons sought for far and near; it knows how to cultivate
its fields; and I saw several times how the young tobacco plants
were moistened with water, and protected from the sun by a roof of
shrubs. The men of nature it contains are tall, and enjoying all
bodily advantages; yet—it has only arrived at this grade of
cultivation. If the perfectibility of nature be so confined, this
truly susceptible people only requires an external intellectual
impetus to regenerate the mythic fame of the Ethiopians.</p>

<p>The hygrometer seems to have got out of order through Arnaud’s
clumsy handling, for it yesterday morning shewed 82°,
notwithstanding the air is far drier and clearer than this height
of the hygrometer would shew. Half-past ten o’clock. We are driven
on the sand, and there we stop to wait for the other vessels. Alas!
the beautiful wind! Two o’clock. We sail on southwards. On the
right two islands. Selim Capitan is said to have the Sultan’s
brother on board his vessel; we are making every exertion,
therefore, to overtake him. The commander no sooner remarks this
than he halts at the nearest island. I repaired immediately to his
vessel, and found two relations of King Làkono on board. Half-past
two o’clock. We leave the island and the previous direction of
S.S.W., and approach the right shore of the river E.S.E. On the
right a gohr, or arm of the Nile, appears to come from S.W., and
indeed from Mount Korèk, or Korèg, as the word is also
pronounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22_v2">[22]</span>The two
distinguished guests sit upon their stools, which they brought with
them, with their own royal hands, in naked innocence, and smoke
their pipes quite delighted. An arm of the river leaves on the left
hand the main stream to the north, and may be connected with a gohr
previously seen. A village stands above the arm of the river on the
right shore of our stream, and an island is immediately under it
before the gohr itself. The name of the village is Ullibari, and
the arm Beregènn. It is said to flow down a very great distance
before it again joins the White Stream. The latter winds here to
the south; to the right we perceive a village on the left shore,
called Igàh. On the right shore we remark several villages, and
those summer huts, or rekùbas, already mentioned. All the tokuls
have higher-pointed roofs, of a tent-like form. The country
generally, in the neighbourhood of the residence of the great
Negro-King, appears very populous. The north wind is favourable.
The black princes look at the sails, and seem to understand the
thing, although the whole must appear colossal to them in
comparison with their surtuks, as we perceive from their mutually
drawing each other’s attention to them. The king’s brother, whose
name is Nikelò, has a friendly-looking countenance; and his
handsome Roman-like head, with the tolerably long curled hair, is
encircled with a strip of fur instead of the laurel. On the right
he wears a yellow copper, on the left a red copper bracelet. The
latter might have been easily taken for an alloy of gold, although
the noble man did not know the gold which was shewn him as being of
higher value, but distinguished that it was a different metal.
Silver he did not know at all. These<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_23_v2">[23]</span> mountains being rich in metals, must
afford very interesting results with respect to the precious
metals. The other guest is called Tombé: he is the son-in-law of
the king; stronger and taller than Nikelò, and always cheerful.</p>

<p>We landed soon afterwards on the right shore, as the nearest
landing-place to the capital, Belènja, on the mountain of the same
name, which was at some distance. They gave us the names of all the
mountains lying around in the horizon. The river flows here from
S.S.W., or rather the right shore has this direction. To N. by W.
Mount Nerkonji, previously mentioned as Niakanja, long seen by us;
to W. by S., Mount Konnobih; behind it, in the far distance, the
mountain-chain of Kugelù; to S.W., the rocky mountain, Korek;
behind which the before-named mountain-chain still extends, and is
lost in misty heights. These do not appear, indeed, to be of much
greater height; but on a more accurate observation, I distinguished
a thin veil, apparently sunk upon them, clearer than the western
horizon, and the blue of the mountain forms vanishing from Kugelù
to the south. As I once looked for the alpine world from
Montpellier, and found it, trusting to my good eye-sight, so now I
gazed for a long time on this region of heights; their peaks were
clearly hung round with a girdle of clouds, apparently shining with
a glimmering light in opposition to the clouds hanging before them
in our neighbourhood. When I view the long undulating chain of
Kugelù, distant at all events, taking into consideration the clear
atmosphere, more than twenty hours behind Konnobih (some twelve
hours off), the highest summit of which, west by south,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24_v2">[24]</span> without losing its horizontal
ridge, disappears first evidently in the west, and is completely
veiled behind Korèk lying nearer over south-west, I conceive that
this Kugelù well deserves the name of a chain of mountains, even if
we only take the enormous angle of the parallax at twenty hours’
distance.</p>

<p>These mountains lie, to all external appearance, upon the left
side of the river, and Nikelò also confirms this. On the right side
of the Nile, we see the low double rocks of Lùluli to S.S.E., and a
little further to S.E. by S., the two low mountains or hills of
Liènajihn and Konnofih lying together. To S.E. Mount Korrejih, and
then lastly to E. the mountain chain of Belenjà, rising up in
several peaks to a tolerable height, but apparently scarcely
elevated more than 1000 feet above the Nile. Far towards S., over
the Lobèk, I remarked from here several other misty mountains, the
names of which I would have willingly learned, for I feared, and
with justice, that they would be invisible in advancing nearer
under the prominences of these African Alps. The royal gentlemen,
however, with whom we stood on an old river bed of six feet high,
were restless, and in a great hurry to take home their presents of
a red coat and glass beads. The city is like all other villages,
but large: the king’s palace consists of several straw tokuls lying
together, encompassed as usual with a seriba; this also
Nalewadtshòn had told us. The Ethiopian palaces, therefore, have
not much to boast of; it is sufficient if the men in them be
pleased and happy, and not oppressed by the cares of government and
want of sustenance. The durra was also here, as I had remarked in
other places, either cut away, or<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25_v2">[25]</span> cropped before it became ripe by the
cattle; no matter,—it sprouted a second time, and promised a good
harvest, though only as yet about seven feet high. I had seen it
thrice as high in Taka, without the people thinking even of cutting
it down or mowing it. Selim Capitan dares not trust the natives; we
went, therefore, ashore at the island close at hand, fixed stakes
in the ground, and tied the vessels fast to them.</p>

<p><span class="sc">24th January</span>.—I repaired to Selim
Capitan, to be present at the reception of the Sultan Làkono. He
had sent two other envoys to announce to us that he would come, and
we were to wait a little. One of these ambassadors was likewise a
younger brother of the king’s, a real giant both in height and
breadth, and coloured red from head to foot; there was not even a
single hair on the whole body of this Hercules that was not red.
His name is Dogalè. Nikelò, already known to us, returned also, but
entirely in his natural state, not having even one of the strings
of beads presented to him round his neck. The other envoy, a
relation of the king’s, is called Betjà. Dogalè lolls very
comfortably on the carpet extended before the cabin, supporting his
long ribs on the little stool placed under him. Favoured by nature
in every respect, he has regular features, and a good-tempered
though not intelligent countenance. All the questions asked of
these high and mighty lords were answered<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_27_v2">[27]</span> with the greatest readiness. Sultan, or
king, is called in their language Matta, which means generally a
lord, but there is no other <em>lord</em> besides him. There is no
one in these countries equal to their Matta in power and strength.
The word Làkono was also pronounced Làgono, for they frequently
change <em>k</em> for <em>g</em>, as well as <em>p</em> for
<em>b</em>, <em>vice versâ</em>, and they vary the fall of the
accent, for example, Belènja and Pelenjà. Làkono has forty wives
and several children, amongst them many grown-up sons. They shew us
the number, not by stretching out the fingers of both hands, but by
holding their clenched fist towards the questioners, in order to
express by that means the number five or ten. Each of the brothers
of the king had six wives, and this appears to be their usual
appanage; for the women are purchased, and they are probably
allowed a certain number of wives, according to their station. A
private man, such as the sheikhs or chiefs of the community, has
only three; the others have only one or two wives, exclusive of the
slaves taken in war or purchased, like the male ones, for iron
weapons. The latter, I learned on my return to the country of the
Bokos, down to which place Làkono has navigated, for the purpose of
purchasing slaves, as they told us there.</p>

<p>We order the drum to be beat and the men to pipe; it was with
difficulty then that they could keep their seats. They do not
display any troublesome prying spirit, or impertinent curiosity;
but they see <em>too much</em> at once, the impression assails them
too powerfully on all sides. I gaze on these people,—they are men
like ourselves, but they are more bashful than we,—not, however, by
any means approaching<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_28_v2">[28]</span> that timidity and helplessness which we
have perceived, for example, among the Keks. They eat dates,
almonds, and raisins, but do not snatch them hastily or greedily.
They take the tinned-copper can (Brik) filled with water from the
wash-hand basin (Tisht), and drink directly from the curved spout,
after having lifted up the cover and ascertained the contents; yet
they have never seen such fruits and such a water-vessel. I observe
them in their mutual confidential conversation, perhaps referring
to us,—what do they think of us? They are not astonished at the
white faces; perhaps they take them to be coloured, like their own
bodies, for our crew display all possible tints of flesh.</p>

<p>I am led to this latter supposition from a couple of women
having previously tried the skin on my face with their wet fingers,
to see if it were painted. The features and form of the head are
quite regular among these gigantic people, and are a striking
contrast to those of our black soldiers, with their more negro-like
physiognomy, although <em>they</em> are not, on the whole, ugly. I
compare the true Caucasian races, who are present, with these men,
and find that the latter have a broader forehead. The inhabitants
of the kingdom of Bari might be designated a protoplasma of the
black race; for not only do they shoot up to a height of from six
and a half to seven Parisian feet,<a id="FNanchor_1v2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1v2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which we have seen also in
the other nations, but their gigantic mass of limbs are in the
noblest proportions. The form of the face is oval, the forehead
arched, the nose straight, or curved, with rather wide
nostrils,—the alæ, however, not projecting disagreeably; the
mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29_v2">[29]</span> full, like
that of the ancient Egyptians; the orifice of the ears large, and
the temples a little depressed. The last we do not find in the
Baràbras, and the races akin to them in Abyssinia. The men of Bari
have, besides, well-proportioned legs, and muscular arms. It is a
pity that they also extract the four lower incisors, for not only
is the face disfigured by this custom when they are laughing, but
their pronunciation also becomes indistinct. They differ, moreover,
from the nations hitherto seen by having no holes in their ears for
ornaments; and they do <em>not tattoo</em> themselves. Yet I
remarked some who had incisions, as imaginary ornaments, on their
shoulders: such exceptions may originate from the mothers being of
another race. I have even seen in the land of Sudàn instances of a
twofold genealogical table in the countenance, because the father
and mother were of different nations. There appears to be no
national custom with respect to wearing the hair long or short; but
generally the hair is short, and not more woolly than that of the
Baràbras and Arabs. On some there was none to be seen, and it
appears either to be removed by a knife or a cauterising process,
such as the women in the harìm use for other parts. Some wear their
hair like a cock’s comb from the forehead down to the nape of the
neck; others have scarcely the crown of the head covered: the most,
however, wear tolerably long hair, in the natural manner, which
gives a significant look to many faces. Their good-natured
countenances correspond also to their jokes among themselves, which
are, perhaps, occasionally directed against us. I have never been
able to discover in the whole journey their reverence for
our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30_v2">[30]</span> race and the
god-like descent, much as this was asserted by Thibaut, who was
with the first expedition.</p>

<p>It does not appear,—at least, we could not make out from
them,—that they recognise one God as the essence of all that is
good and beautiful, who punishes and rewards; but neither do they
worship idols, for that, I believe, I have fully ascertained. They
treat one another with frank brotherly love, stand embracing each
other, divide the fruits given to them, assist in embarking and
disembarking from the vessels to the shore; and all this in an
affectionate manner. But yet they must have their peculiar ideas of
friends and enemies, of injuries and revenge, and be drawn to
commit acts, which we can scarcely imagine, when we see such an
apparently harmless people of nature.</p>

<p>Skill in arms, which is generally not to be despised, is an
accomplishment most desirable of all to a man living in a state of
nature. The first things he seeks are weapons against the wild
beasts; the fist, therefore, which Nature has given for seizing and
striking, is used for this purpose. The first weapon is the club:
even the poorest person here carries this instrument of defence.
Then man learns to know the different arms of animals,—the eye,
tooth, and the horn; therefore, we see here some of the clubs
pointed at one end, in order to cut into the enemy’s ribs in case
of necessity, directly the blow from it is parried by the shield or
casque. The stone, used by monkeys, and especially by the large
cynocephali, for defence, as I was convinced, perforce, in the
country of the Troglodytes, among the rocks of Kàffela el Lus, and
which the modern Greeks are especially expert in throwing, does not
appear to be used here as an instrument<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_31_v2">[31]</span> of warfare. <em>Iron</em> spears and darts
did not come till later, although they may have had them long
previously of wood, such as we see even now. The most useful
working implements, the knife, hatchet, &amp;c., are next
introduced; and from these also other weapons originate; the spear,
not being fixed firmly on the shaft, became used as a two-edged
knife, and the battle-axe might have followed the hatchet.</p>

<p>To speak of religious principles among these people would be out
of place. Family love, the mutual living together, and the same
customs and habits may form the basis of their moral principles,
and be the <em>first</em> axiom of <em>mutual forbearance</em>. The
first external sight which might produce, if not astonishment, at
least a feeling of attachment and love, even to veneration, must be
what makes a deep impression on the soul: for example, the sun and
moon; or what gives sustenance, as the corn, for instance; or
protection and comfort, as the shady tree, &amp;c. The moon is,
probably, in higher esteem here than the burning sun, although the
latter was certainly very agreeable to the natives when they
collected themselves before daybreak on the shore, and stood each
by his little fire, kindled on account of the cold, and fed by the
reed-stalks growing between their extended legs. I could not
ascertain that there was such a veneration for these two heavenly
bodies, nevertheless I believe as much from their expressions and
narrations. Although these were only repeated to us in a
fragmentary manner, and their explanation assisted by gestures, yet
they shew that valour, like the <em>virtus</em> of the Romans, is
the essence of all virtues, to which all<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_32_v2">[32]</span> others, springing from their pure
uncorrupted nature, are subordinate.</p>

<p>The man wears the skin of the wild beasts he has slain, not as a
covering, but as an ornament and triumphant spoil. If it were not
so hot here, he would, like the ancient Germans, wear their scalp
on his head as a war-cap. He carries the daring weapon of the wild
boar killed by him—the tusk—upon a bracelet or frontlet. I saw also
some wearing on the arm, as an ornament, an imitation of a boar’s
tusk, made of ivory; and, as already mentioned, they have iron
bulls’ horns on their bracelets. As the heads of these two animals
so often appear as emblems in German escutcheons, so here also they
are less considered as the memorials of dangers overcome than as
signs of reverence or esteem of this <em>valiant</em> beast. If the
rings with horns were more general, I should believe that, as the
men on the White Stream display an uncommon love and affection for
their cattle, they carried these horns, like the ancients did the
phallus, as the attribute of fertility, unless the custom here had
not the narrower signification of an Ethiopian Apis, or Father of
Cattle.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile about fifteen hundred negroes may have been
collected on the shore, not including those scattered on every
side. They are armed without exception, and indeed with all their
weapons,—a sight sending a thrill of horror through the veins of
the Frenchmen and Turks, which is shewn plainly enough in various
ways. They have only the consolation, and this ought to have
prevented them before from feeling any fear at a danger not really
existing—that we have, in truth, the grandees of the kingdom on
board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33_v2">[33]</span> our vessels,
and that they continue to be in the best humour, and certainly have
no evil design, for Nature’s stamp imprinted on the human
countenance cannot be deceptive here. Even Suliman Kashef has
become quiet, and is perhaps turning over in his mind how he shall
act in case of a sudden attack.</p>

<p>All the natives have set up their “hui ih!” several times, and
at every time we stretch out our necks towards the neighbouring
shore to see what is going on. This “hui ih” always resounds <em>à
tempo</em>, as if at word of command; there must be therefore an
analogous signal, though our ears cannot distinguish it over the
water. It is a cry of joy intended for their Matta. We are still
waiting for him, but in vain; and in the meantime we din the ears
of our guests with drumming and fifing. They are also plied
continually with sweets. Again and again they enjoy them, and do
not prefer the sugar to the fruit, but eat slowly one after the
other, as if they had been accustomed to them from youth upwards,
and laugh and jest with us. We hear from them that the kingdom of
Bari extends for four days’ journey down the river; that the latter
is called, in their language, Tubirih, and has its origin at a long
distance off, but they know not whether from the mountains or the
valley. There are said to be several other nations on its shores,—a
sign, perhaps, of the considerable distance of its sources. These
tribes have also a different language, but <em>there is no matta so
powerful as Làkono</em>; which saying, since we have been in the
kingdom of Bari, they are never tired of repeating. The red Goliath
lolls and stretches himself in the most comfortable manner, and the
others also change their position from time to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_34_v2">[34]</span> time, and do not remain, like pagodas
or the Egyptian statues of kings, in the lazy repose called by the
Turks <em>kew</em>. Dogalè is pleased at being measured; he is six
feet six inches, Parisian measure, in height, with an unusual
development in breadth, powerful shoulders, and a chest that might
be used as an anvil. The two others, however, are not so large,
although far overtopping us. The large brass bells, brought by us
as presents for the cattle, pleased them very much, and they give
us plainly to understand that they can hear the sound of such a
bell at a distance.</p>

<p>We tell them that we want wood for our vessels; they shout to
the people, but the latter appear to pay very little attention, or
do not like to go away from our vessels, keeping a sharp look out
on them, either from the interest of novelty, or in case of any
future danger to their men; and perhaps, in this respect, they are
not armed in vain. When our guests were repeatedly requested to
procure wood, they tell us to fire among the people, even if we
should kill a couple of men. They laugh whilst saying this, and it
really appears that they do not believe in the possibility of
shooting a man dead, and only wish to frighten their people by the
report. They would have us, however, fire; and Selim Capitan
therefore ordered his long gun to be handed him, and fired in the
air close to them; they were dreadfully startled by the report, but
immediately afterwards laughed, and wanted us to repeat it. This
was done. I should have liked to have made a rough sketch of the
group, but I was far too unwell, and very thankful even that I was
able to sit, and write down on the spot what I heard and saw.
A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35_v2">[35]</span> fine field was
open here for a painter or sculptor; these colossal
well-proportioned figures—no fat, all muscle—so that it was
delightful to look at them, with the exception of the calves of
their legs, which were formed like lumps of flesh. No beard is
developed either in young or old, and yet it does not appear that
they use a cosmetic to extirpate it. If Selim Capitan pleased them
better with his smooth shaven chin, than the long-bearded Suliman
Kashef, yet they exhibited a kind of horror when he shewed them his
hairy breast, which perhaps appeared to them more fit for a beast
than a man.</p>

<p>Therefore the supposition that they extract the four lower
incisors not to be similar to beasts, has at least some apparent
foundation, although the under jaw does not project, and,
consequently, the lips are not made smaller by this extraction. Man
here is always indeed elevated far above the beast, and needs,
therefore, no such mutilation of the teeth. Our Dinkas, who
themselves want the four lower incisors, have no other reason to
allege for it, than that they do it to avoid the similarity to a
beast, especially to the ass (Homàr), as is the general answer in
Sennaar, to questions on this subject. The Turks take it for a kind
of circumcision, just as we might suppose it meant a baptismal
rite, being the sign of an act of incorporation by that means in a
vast Ethiopian nation, divided now into several tribes. As this
extraction of the teeth first takes place in boyhood, it might be
considered to denote the commencement of manhood, and capability of
bearing arms; but I have never heard of the ceremonies which would
necessarily, if that were the fact, take<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36_v2">[36]</span> place on the occasion. There is also
another objection to this supposition, viz.,—that a similar
operation is performed on the girls. With respect to the eyes, they
are full and well formed, like those of all the negroes of the
White River, but with a dirty yellow white, which, in the
inhabitants of the marshes, is generally suffused with blood in a
shocking manner.</p>

<p>At last then it was determined to fire off a cannon, to see what
impression this thunder would make upon them. They sat upright upon
their stools—off went the gun, and the princes nearly kissed the
planks on the opposite side, as if they had been felled by a blow.
They sat up, however, immediately again, laughing loudly all the
time, and wanted us to fire again: their request was complied with,
but they crouched down low again to the side, were uncommonly
pleased, and requested one more repetition of this report. Not a
negro, however, was to be seen on all the shore; and it was feared,
with justice, that the Sultan, who could not be far off, might be
struck by a panic and return: the firing was therefore
discontinued.</p>

<p>Intelligence arrives that King Làkono will be with us about
three o’clock in the afternoon; whereupon the blacks, being
suitably clothed by us, and hung round with strings of beads, took
their leave with the red Dogalè, all except Lombè, who is one of
the king’s subjects, and a sheikh in a neighbouring district down
the river. The latter is a very sensible, quiet man, with a more
intellectual physiognomy than the others; the Turks give themselves
all possible trouble to obtain information from him about the gold.
He says that Mount Pelenja itself does<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_37_v2">[37]</span> not contain copper; that Làkono, however,
has a good deal of copper in his house, brought from other
mountains at a distance; that Làkono’s dress also came from this
country, which is called Berri. Moreover, he took the gold bar
shewn to him for a different species of copper; and, as he does not
know how to distinguish gold, the latter may be found blended with
copper in the royal treasury, and the mountains of Berri may be
auriferous. The population is clearly very large, but he could not
give us the number. He named several districts, part of which bore
the names of the neighbouring mountains; and it almost seems to me
as if there had been earlier independent tribes, who were first
subdued by the great Làkono. He does not appear either to be a good
royalist, and was evidently glad when the king’s sons had
withdrawn; he then put on a familiar look, which their presence had
hindered him from doing previously. There seems to be no doubt that
this country is a central point of negro cultivation, although
Berri and other succeeding countries, may be superior to the
kingdom of Bari. I am curious about the Sultan’s dress. As Berri is
said to lie to the east, perhaps it was not made there, but has
come, by means of barter, from India. Lombè also went away richly
decorated (for the Turks cannot contain themselves now at the idea
of gold El Dahab), in order, probably, to meet the Sultan, or,
perhaps, to get out of his sight with the treasures he had
acquired.</p>

<p>I returned to my house, or rather my ship, to take my usual nap
at noon; but the right shore being close at hand, separated only
from our island by a narrow<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_38_v2">[38]</span> canal, obliges me almost immediately to
rise again. The multifarious and manifold adorned and unadorned
people afford a pleasing sight as I look at them from my windows. I
view, as if from a box at the opera, the stage of black life on the
whole length of the shore. Two women appear among the others; their
<em>anteriora</em> and <em>posteriora</em> covered with two
semicircular leathern aprons, tanned red, according to the usual
custom here. One is coloured red from head to foot; the other has
only her still youthful firm breasts and her head of that hue. She
looks, therefore, as if she wore a black narrow jacket under the
breasts, and breeches of the same colour under the red apron. She
may have been surprised in her toilette by the news of our arrival,
and have run off to the shore just as she was; the whole lower part
of the body from the breasts downwards was tattooed in the manner
customary on the White River.</p>

<p>Buying and bartering are going on; cheating and robbing—the
latter, however, only on our side. My servants are on the shore,
and making gestures and signs with their fingers, to know what they
shall purchase for me of the national wares. I do not bargain in
person, for I am afraid of the sun. The people, in spite of their
good humour, are, as I have convinced myself here, surprisingly
mistrustful. Goods and the price of their purchase, are exchanging
hands simultaneously. As the people transact but little business
among themselves, it is very natural and right that they should
exercise precaution in their transactions with a foreign people
like ourselves; and it is certain that we have given the first
cause for suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39_v2">[39]</span>As I said
before, the hair is generally kept short; they decorate it, for
want of something better, with a cock’s or guinea-fowl’s feather. A
more elaborate coiffure is of black ostrich-feathers, placed
together in a globular form, and the lower ends plaited, in a
little basket, the thickness of a fist. This tress-work, holding
the feathers, stands on the centre of the head, fastened by two
strings round the neck, and appears pretty generally worn. Prince
Dogalè also wore one, but of somewhat larger size. Some have their
hair, which is tolerably long, smeared so thick with ochre, that
merely little tufts are to be seen hanging about. Moreover, leather
caps, fitting exactly to the skull, were worn with long or short
tassels, hardly to be distinguished from the coloured hair. This
antique kind of covering for the head, from which the Greeks and
Romans formed their helmets, is similar, as regards form, to the
modern fesi or tarbush and takië (the cotton under-cap worn under
the Turkish knitting-worsted cap). They appear here to serve
principally as a protection against the sun. It was only with
difficulty that I could procure two different specimens, and the
sellers pointed quite dolefully to the hot sun, when they bared
their shaven heads.</p>

<p>Leathern strings, as also strings consisting of aglets, strung
in a row, not made, as I thought at first, of conchylia, but of the
shells of ostrich-eggs, were slung round their hips. Several of the
latter strings, which are also much in request with the women in
Belled Sudàn, and require laborious work, were purchased by the
crew, and I got, also, specimens, but they were all, with one
exception, immediately purloined.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_40_v2">[40]</span> To my great astonishment, I saw
subsequently in the Imperial Cabinet of Arts at Berlin, with which
my Ethnographical collection is incorporated, a string exactly
similar, which Mr. Von Olfers had brought from the Brazils. These
strings wander, therefore, from the north of Africa to the west
coast of that part of the globe, and from thence with the slaves to
America, in the same way as they come from the other side to
Sennaar by means of the slaves; or it may be, that they are made of
the same size by the American savages. If the former be the case,
this single fact would shew that there is a connection between the
country of Bari and the Atlantic Ocean. I was told that the blacks
break in pieces the ostrich-eggs, grind the fragments on a stone to
a circular form of about two lines in diameter, and then string one
lamina after another on a thread, to the length of several ells—a
work which requires great patience.</p>

<p>Sometimes from mere stupid wantonness, shots were fired in the
air from the vessels, and the natives disappeared from the shore
for a short time, but returned directly that the report of the
shots died away. Several women now approached, part of them decked
with the before-named leathern apron, and part with a rahàt girded
round their hips, as in the land of Sudàn. The threads hanging down
from the girdle are not narrow slips of leather, such as those in
Sennaar, but twisted cotton, and only the length of a finger. These
scarcely form in front a light thread apron of a span in breadth,
and leave the hips free, on which laces with tassels and small iron
chains hang down, and a tuft falls down over the os sacrum, moving
to and fro when they walk like an animal’s tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41_v2">[41]</span>Now I see that
the women <em>wish</em> to paint themselves, as I saw them before.
There are two who have coloured their nipples and navels to the
size of a dollar. The breasts are more rounded, and have not that
horizontal conical form found in the black slaves of the land of
Sudàn. I have already previously remarked that the women on the
White Stream possess modesty in the concrete sense of the word; and
though part of them are young and beautiful, but not tall, compared
with the men, yet they regard these naked and magnificent manly
forms without any immodest look; so, likewise, the men, kings of
the world, gaze tranquilly upon the women. I am fully persuaded
that, where woman bears in her mind the principle of the most
necessary covering, naked truth is exactly the thing to keep up
constantly a chaste as well as a decent relation between the sexes.
Only give these women the deceits of the dress of European ladies,
and clothe the men, and we shall see what will become of the
<em>blameless Ethiopians!</em></p>

<p>I am the more desirous to see continual repetitions of the
sights peculiar to the land of Bari, because, by the festive
occasion of the royal visit, these are multiplied in every form,
and therefore I am still acquiring much knowledge. The square
shields, about three feet long and two feet broad, with scallopped
edges projecting into four sharp points, appear to be little used.
They are of neat’s hide, and have a stick badly fixed in the centre
to hold them by, the edge of which is not even turned to give a
firmer hold. They have blue and red stripes crossed, each of a
hand’s breadth, as their external<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_42_v2">[42]</span> decoration, and these are coloured with
earth, so that they are easily obliterated. The Frenchmen made
white stripes with chalk between these colours, and thus was the
tricolour found in the middle of Africa. Whether the blue and red
streaks serve as signs to distinguish one party from the other in
warfare, I know not. <em>Generally</em> the men here carried round,
high-arched hand-shields, a foot in length, made of very solid
thick leather. These hand-shields appear now, and perhaps
exclusively, adapted for warding off a blow with the clubs, for
they would probably be of little avail as a protection against
arrows and spears to such colossal bodies, in spite of all the
dexterity of these men. Yet they gave me to understand previously,
that they warded off hostile spears by means of these shields.</p>

<p>The boar’s tusks on the bracelets were mostly imitations of
ivory, and therefore like the small iron bull’s horns, are perhaps
symbols of valour and the power of nature. They had, besides, all
kinds of knick-knackeries on the arm and neck, such as little
tortoise-shells, dogs’ or monkeys’ teeth, entire strings of which
even they wear, pieces of bones, &amp;c. It struck me that little
bones of this kind are either remembrances or amulets, from the
circumstance of their always wishing to retain them when we had
already purchased the articles to which they were fastened. The
iron necklaces were of very different kinds: close to them were
iron ornaments arranged in a row, in the form of a narrow leaf, or
in small open spindles, from which little red fruits projected. I
observed here also, the wide iron rings for the neck, of the
thickness of a finger, which reach over the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_43_v2">[43]</span> head, and down to the middle of the
breast, and are not only worn in Khartùm, but also in Egypt, by the
daughters of the Fellàhs. We here find an old fellow who will not
sell his spear, the shaft of which is roughly wrought from iron,
and who laughs at the sug-sug offered to him as idle toys.</p>

<p>I must break off for the moment from this subject, for a fresh
clamour resounds, and the cry of “Hui, ih;” therefore away I go to
Selim Capitan. We do not sit long with anxious curiosity, and look
at the vacant carpet on which the great Matta was to recline, under
the shade of the ship’s tent (Denda, perhaps derived from the
Italian <em>tenda</em>, for a war-tent is called Gemma, and a
shepherd’s-tent of straw-mats Birsh), for the sandal which had
fetched the supreme chief from the right shore, arrives. The Melek
or Sultan, as the Turks and Arabs call him, on account of his vast
power, steps on our vessel, with a retinue of followers, part of
whom we knew. The dress and coiffure distinguish his tall figure
from all the others. Notwithstanding every one removed on one side,
and we form a divàn upon cushions and chests around the carpet
before the cabin, yet he treads upon the vessel with an insecure
step, for he has his eyes directed towards us, and stumbles against
the projecting foot of the gun-carriage. He carried his throne
himself,—the little wooden stool, which we should call a
foot-stool, and of which all make use; but he bore also an awful
sceptre, consisting of a club: its thick knob was studded with
large iron nails, to inspire greater respect.</p>

<p>At the Arabic invitation, “fadl ochaut,” accompanied by a motion
of the hand, he took his seat on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_44_v2">[44]</span> the oval and somewhat hollowed-out stool,
of about one foot long, and three quarters of a foot broad. There
is something naturally dignified in his countenance and bearing,
without any assumption; he looks at the semicircle surrounding him,
so that he may not do anything derogatory to his position as
Sultan, seeking probably him who is pointed out as the matta, or
whom he takes to be our matta. He then slides along to Selim
Capitan, who might appear to him to be of that rank from his
corpulence, takes his right hand, and <em>sucks</em> his
finger-ends, which appears to me a humiliation. The large-bearded
Suliman Kashef, vain and proud like all Circassians, wanted to have
the same honour paid to him, and held out his fist with its
powerful broad knuckles; but King Làkono was autocrat enough to
conclude, from the principle of his sovereignty, that two mattas or
monarchs could not be or exist by the side of one another. Selim
Capitan, therefore, was to him the only real and supreme head of
the foreigners, and he refused this homage in a very contemptuous
manner to Suliman Kashef, who, contrary to his usual custom, was
not arrayed in all his bravery to-day. In order not to make himself
ridiculous, the latter suppressed the word “Kiàffar,” or “Abd,”
which I saw was already trembling on his lips.</p>

<p>Làkono’s brother, and a couple of his suite, as also the Crown
Prince Tshobè, whom we had not seen before, clearly endeavoured,
without however throwing one glance of disapprobation at the old
man, to repair this misunderstanding, occasioned by their peculiar
etiquette, by paying all of us great lords the honour of
finger-sucking. One thing was that the fingers<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_45_v2">[45]</span> could not be bitten off in this
operation, owing to their lower teeth being wanting. As a testimony
of welcoming and friendship, they stroked also our arms. They had
not done this previously, perhaps because the king had not yet
assured us of his favour.</p>

<p>That deliberations took place among the household of the king
about the possible aim of our journey, may be presumed; both
because the Sultan not only kept away for a long time,
notwithstanding his residence was only three hours distant, but
also from other indistinct intimations, and from the very
intelligible previous warning, that we were to remain on the right
shore, at the original landing-place, because the Matta would not
allow us to move any <em>further</em>. Of course we did not take
any notice of this warning, and would not understand it. Perhaps
the white faces of another world, our vessels larger than their
palaces, in which we go up the river without oars, when the wind is
favourable, and especially the thunder and explosion of our cannons
and guns, might have been the principal motive that induced the
wise council to come to the reasonable opinion that it would be a
ticklish affair to spit us like bats, or to kill us like dogs with
clubs.</p>

<p>When we little expected it, the Sultan raised his voice, without
commanding <em>silentium</em> beforehand with his sceptre, and
sang—his eyes directed firmly and shining on us—a song of welcome,
with a strong, clear voice. This was soon ended, and the song had
brightened him up surprisingly, for he looked quite merrily around,
as far as his eyes, which were apparently effected by a cataract,
would allow him. This misfortune might be the cause also why he
walked, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46_v2">[46]</span> if in a
mist, with an insecure step on the vessel. According to the
translation passed by two interpreters from one to the other into
Arabic, he chanted us as being bulls, lions, and defenders of the
Penates (Tiràn, Sing Tor, Assad and Aguàn el bennàt).</p>

<p>He is of an imposing figure, with a regular countenance, marked
features, and has somewhat of a Roman nose. We noticed on all the
bare parts of his body remains of ochre, apparently not agreeing
very well with the skin, for here and there on the hands it was
cracked. He was the first man whom we had hitherto found
clothed.</p>

<p>His temples are slightly depressed; on his head he wore a high
bonnet, in the form of a bear-skin cap, covered over and over with
black ostrich-feathers, which were fixed inside by an oval
net-work. His feather-tiara was fastened under his chin by two
straps; two other stiff red straps, with small leather tufts,
projected like horns over both temples; these horns denote here,
perhaps, the royal dignity, like the caps of horns (Takië betal
Gorn) of the Moluks, in Belled-Sudàn, and may be an imitation of
Ammon, or of Moyses. He shook his cap very often in real pleasure.
A long and wide blue cotton shirt, with long open sleeves, lined
inside with white cotton, reached down to the feet from the throat,
where it was hollowed out round, and had a red border. A large blue
and white chequered cotton band, bound round the hips, held this
dress together. He wore round the neck strings of blue glass paste,
and rings of thin twisted iron wire. The feet were covered with
well-worked red sandals, of thick leather. Bright polished iron
rings, the thickness of the little<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_47_v2">[47]</span> finger, reached from the ankles to the
calf, exactly fitting to the flesh, and increasing in size as they
went up the leg. Above these he wore another serrated ring, and a
thin chain. The knuckles of the right hand were surrounded with an
iron and a red copper ring, of twisted work. On the left hand he
had a prettily decorated yellow copper ring, with a dozen narrow
iron rings, likewise fitted exactly to the arm. As we subsequently
saw, the upper part of both arms was surrounded with two heavy
ivory rings, of a hand’s breadth. Contrary to the usual custom, he
had also the <em>four lower incisors</em>; we could not ascertain
the cause of this distinction, and at our question on the subject,
he only answered with a cunning laugh. I soon remarked, moreover,
that he wanted the upper teeth; yet he may have lost them from old
age, for want of teeth is common even among these people, and he
might have numbered some sixty years.</p>

<p>This want of sound teeth—as negroes are always distinguished for
good teeth, and the marshy soil has entirely ceased in the country
of Bari—may perhaps only arise from eating some fruit unknown to
us, such as the cassavas in Guiana, which have the same effect; or
the reason for it may be sought in their pulling them out directly
they pain them, with their iron instruments, always at hand. The
constant smoking of their very strong tobacco, with the absence of
cleanliness, which, however, is not the case with our Nuba negroes,
may contribute to this imperfection. At first he smoked the cigar
given him, and then the Turkish pipe, with the air of an old
smoker; for smoking is a general custom among the
nations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48_v2">[48]</span> on the
White Nile. Dates were set before him, and the others picked him
out the best, and breaking them in two, laid the stones in a heap,
and gave him the fruit in his hand, partaking of them with him.</p>

<p>The music which had accompanied him to the shore, and embarked
on board the vessel, consisted of a drum, made out of the trunk of
a tree, and beaten with sticks, a kind of clarionet, and a fife,
different only from the small ones worn by all the natives round
their necks by being three or four times larger. King Làkono’s
dress and copper rings came from the country of Berri; this was a
confirmation of what we had already heard. He had never seen
horses, asses, or camels, and it seemed as if there were no words
in his language to denote them; nor did he know of an unicorn, and
did not understand our explanation of these animals. If the Arabs
in the land of Sudàn do not deny the existence of the unicorn in
the interior of Africa, and even assert that there are some, if the
subject be followed up further, this arises from politeness, in
order that they may correspond with our desire to prove the real
existence of such an animal and is not what they know to be
truth.</p>

<p>Làkono made himself comfortable afterwards, and sat down upon
the carpet, moving his little stool under his shoulders. A red
upper garment was fetched, and the Turks made him comprehend that
he must stand up to have it put on. They bound a white shawl round
his ribs, and another was twisted round his head, as a turban,
after they had clapped on him a tarbusch. On this, one of the two
slaves who accompanied him placed on his own head the
royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49_v2">[49]</span> feather-cap,
and laughed behind his master’s back. This only lasted, however, a
minute, though the others took no offence at it. The dress
altogether, was found to be too short and scanty for such limbs.
Several strings of beads were hung round Làkono’s neck, and several
more piled up before him, to take to his wives; hereupon he could
rest no longer, and went off, followed by all the others.</p>

<p>He was taken back by the sandal to the right shore, where his
people shouted to him a “hui ih!” and afforded him an assisting
hand when disembarking from the vessel, as well as on the shore
itself, according to the usual practice among themselves. We fired
off cannons in honour to him, as soon as he set foot on land. Fear
thrilled through them all, and even the Sultan set off running for
a moment, till he was disabused of his panic, probably by his
brothers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">25th January</span>.—At eleven o’clock we leave
our island at the right shore, and halt towards the south, for the
north-east wind is favourable to us. On the right and left are
several little villages, and on the right shore a low foreland,
which we had already visited and found very fertile. Several
poison-trees stand near the village lying in the background. The
bushàr and garrua have not left us, but cover the greatest part of
the shore, where the thorn-bushes appear to diminish, the nearer we
approach the equator. We remark the very same circumstance with
respect to the mimosas, and in those that we still here and there
see, the leaves are broader and seem to announce varieties or
different species. Even the tamarind-tree, from which we have
already gathered ripe fruit, has a different physiognomy here to
what we see in the country of the Shilluks; the branches are more
slender, and the larger leaves are not so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51_v2">[51]</span> thickly piled one upon the other. I was
laughed at by my servant when I asked the name of this tree.</p>

<p>We sail along the left shore, and advance three miles and a
half; but one ship soon gets obstructed here, another there, and
the water-track pointed out to us by the natives is really very
narrow. The stream, which might previously have been about three
hundred paces, is here certainly five hundred. A large island, with
another smaller one, covered with durra, rises out of it. At one
o’clock S.S.W., in which direction we sail now at the right shore,
where the water is better than we had thought. The negroes continue
to run along the shore, or in the shallow places plunge into the
water, and cry as loud as they can to us to stop a little and
barter with them. The right shore is planted with durra, but it is
already harvested. It is a small reddish kind, giving but little
meal. At the previous landing-places there were, amongst other
plants, several small creeping beans, of white and red colour,
thriving luxuriantly on the ground. A small island on our left.</p>

<p>I hear, from the mast, that nineteen mountains (gùbàl) are
counted, without reckoning the small ones. The chain of mountains
is, properly speaking, not wooded; but that which looks like a
forest, from a distance is, in reality, the fragments of rocks,
with which they are nearly all studded at the base: yet between
these blocks a tree and copsewood here and there thrives, which may
sprout out beautifully green in the rainy season. A splendid
ground, covered with trees, and inclined towards the river,
approaches to the foot of the Korek, but does not probably afford
the shade we suppose at a distance. The shores are not
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52_v2">[52]</span> very strongly
intersected with layers of sand, but also the mould of the dam
itself is completely mixed with sand. Therefore it seems that the
river enters now into a rocky bed, from the mountains of which
there is not much fertility to wash away.</p>

<p>Two o’clock; W. by S. On the left shore again, several of those
round-headed beautiful trees, with large acacia-leaves, under which
the negroes seek for shade. The Frenchmen had, according to
yesterday’s measuring, 4° 40′ north latitude, and 41° 42′ east
longitude, from Paris. Selim-Capitan, however, found 4° 35′ north
latitude, and 30° east longitude. At half-past two o’clock we go
with the river S.S.W., which direction it seems to retain for the
present. On the left an island. The people still continue to shout,
but they run no longer, as if they were mad, into the water, to
cling to and hold fast to the vessels, for the sailors rap their
fingers smartly; but stand quietly on one foot, resting the other
against the knee. Three o’clock; S.S.W. The water is not bad, and
we shall have, perhaps, a good course for a considerable time, if
we only sound properly. On the right there is a small island, with
a couple of tokuls behind upon the shore. Immediately on the left
is another shallow island, with luxuriant durra. The natives wade
through the water to an island situated not far from the left
shore, upon which we see a farmyard. Two more islands follow this
one, and they swarm with black people. Four o’clock. The direction
of the river is always still S.W., whilst we seek for deeper water
in the windings of the stream. Right and left are islands, and also
tokuls, part of which peep over the trees. The forms of the
mountains become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53_v2">[53]</span>
more visible and different from what they had hitherto appeared.
This produces uncommon changes in the landscape, where all the
surface of the earth is picturesquely skirted with trees.</p>

<p>Who would have thought of such a beautiful country in the centre
of Africa, and looked for such a well-proportioned, gigantic race
as we see yonder! They are real giants. Go on shore, look at the
Turks, the Christians, and our other companions,—what children they
seem standing in the middle of this crowd of Titans. Half-past four
o’clock. Rocks shew themselves, for the first time, in the river.
Three large, and several small ones form an ominous crossline for
our voyage. At five o’clock we halt at an island near these rocks.
Here there are picturesque materials enough, and nothing shall
prevent me from taking a panorama of this region.</p>

<p>The people appear to be favoured of God as of heaven itself. The
sun and moon do not appear to excite any unusual ideas here,
although the former may be welcome in the morning, when they shake
off the night’s frost with the ashes, and in the evening to light
them when they return from the chase, from labour in the fields,
and from battle, or when they drive home their herds. The moon is
of less service to them, for they go to roost with the fowls. The
beneficent deeds of these two luminaries are too regular. But the
canopy of heaven itself may direct their thoughts above; from
thence comes the rain, irrigating their fields, causing the stream
to increase, filling and animating anew their large fish-ponds.
God’s water is allowed to flow over God’s land, and they are
pleased at the cheerful<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54_v2">[54]</span> harvest, without praying, beseeching, and
returning thanks, for they may look upon periodical rain as a
regular tribute from above. Heaven does not forsake her people
here, and the inexorable sun, parching up everything, has perhaps
never been worshipped by the Ethiopians.</p>

<p>We lie now to the eastern side of the island of Tshànker. King
Làkono visited us to-day a second time, and brought with him a
young wife from his harìm. He took off his hand the orange-coloured
ring, on which Selim Capitan fixed a longing eye, and presented it
to him with a little iron stool, plainly forged in a hurry. The
Crown-prince, Tshobè, has a very intelligent countenance, and seems
to me to be a clever fellow. He wears no ornament on the upper part
of his arms, except the two large ivory rings. Although it was
known that he would succeed King Làkono, and that the latter had
called him his eldest son and successor, yet the Turks believed
that he was some relation of the king’s, whom he had only brought
with him to receive presents. I had, however, previously seen him
with us, and remarked at that time that he kept back proudly when
the others stepped forward for our gifts. But Làkono had only
presented us with two oxen, and given us a verbal mandate to the
republicans of the left shore; therefore, the Turks were
discontented. Against all policy, the honour of a Turkish
coronation-mantle was not conferred upon Tshobè, nor on the others
who might have expected a dress. The prince took the miserable
glass beads with a kind of indifference and contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55_v2">[55]</span>We gathered
further intelligence about the country, and Làkono was complaisant
enough to communicate to us some general information. With respect
to the Nile sources, we learn that it requires a month, the
signification of which was interpreted by thirty days, to come to
the country of Anjan towards the south, where the Tubirih (Bah’r el
Abiad) separates into four shallow arms, and the water only reaches
up to the ankles. Thirty days seems indeed a long time, but the
chain of mountains itself may present great impediments, and
hostile tribes and the hospice stations may cause circuitous
routes. These latter appear necessary, for the natives being
already overladen with weapons and ornaments, it is impossible that
they can carry provisions for so long a time, from the want of
beasts of burden. There are said to be found very high mountains on
this side, in comparison with which the ones now before us are
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Làkono did not seem, according to my views, to understand
rightly the question, whether <em>snow</em> was lying on these
mountains. He answered, however, <em>No</em>. Now, when I consider
the thing more closely, it is a great question to me whether he and
his interpreter have a word for snow; for though the Arabic word
telki or snow is known perhaps in the whole land of Sudàn, yet
<em>that</em> itself is unknown. Whether these four brooks forming
the White Stream come from rocks or from the ground, Làkono could
not say for he had not gone further. With respect to the country of
Berri, which he stated in his first visit was likewise a month
distant, Làkono now corrected himself and said that this country is
not thirty, but only<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56_v2">[56]</span> ten days’ journey off to the east. He
impressed on us particularly that copper is as abundant, and found
there in the same manner as iron here. He appears, indeed, to wish
to inflame our gold-seeking hearts by his repeated commendations of
this country, on purpose that he may get possession, at one blow,
of the treasures, with the assistance of our fire-arms. He expected
an answer which could not be given him, because the Dinkaui, who
translated his words into Arabic, only told us (according to my
full conviction) what he chose to let us know, most probably being
induced by the other soldiers and sailors to do everything he could
for our speedy return.</p>

<p>We also heard that on the road water is found, but that in Berri
itself there is <em>no river</em>, and that the natives drink from
<em>springs</em> (Birr). The people of Bari get their salt, which
is quite clear and fine-grained, from thence. It is boiled in
earthen pots, and retains their form. The language of the country
of Berri is different from that of Bari. The blue beads, in the
form of little cylinders, which we saw on Làkono and some others,
and had even found previously, came also from Berri. We had
similar-formed glass paste, of white and blue colours; but the
higher value was set on the blue, and on the large, round, blue
beads.</p>

<p>Commercial intercourse in Berri does not seem to be carried on
in a very peaceful manner, according to what we had heard
previously, and also now from some of the King’s companions; for it
is boasted that on the way home copper is plundered from the people
on the road, with whom they take up their quarters, and who have it
piled up in their houses. They say that the men on the copper
mountains are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57_v2">[57]</span>
very bad set; and that therefore they are obliged to take from them
again the spears which they had given them for copper. In Berri
also the people go naked, and there are few dresses such as Làkono
possesses. The latter asserts that his dominion reaches seven days’
journey further up the river. Much might be learnt if there were
more order, on our side, in the questions; but they are jumbled up
one with the other, and asked more for amusement than for
scientific interests, without once reflecting whether the answer
corresponds to the question or not.</p>

<p>The favourite Sultana had certainly not much to boast of in the
way of beauty, but she was an amiable looking woman: she was not at
all shy, and looked freely around her. A number of glass beads were
given to her, and she was too much of a woman and negress not to be
exceedingly delighted at them. Làkono restrained himself, as at the
first time, on the sight of such presents, within the limits of
pleasing surprise, without betraying the least symptom of the
childish joy which is indigenous in these men of nature. She was,
however, very cordial with him, and he with her; he helped her even
to pack together her ornaments in a handkerchief, and gave it over
to her with a benevolent look. I had the honour also of a friendly
smile from her, which I naturally returned. She remarked this
immediately to her lord and master, whereupon the latter bowed his
entire approbation, and smiled at me.</p>

<p>This queen was very simply adorned for her rank. Her head was
shaven quite bare, without a diadem and other ornaments; her hair,
the embellishment of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_58_v2">[58]</span> woman, was therefore put to the sword, and
with it also the first advantageous impression, even if the nose
had not been slightly turned in. She was simply clothed with two
leathern aprons, under which, through her continually shifting her
seat, I caught sight of a rahàt. A number of polished iron rings
were spread over the joints of her hands and feet. A narrow ring of
ivory was on the upper part of each arm; and around the neck a
large iron ring, from which a great tooth, a flat little bell, and
some other knick-knackeries of iron, hung down to her breasts,
which are already tolerably withered, for she has probably borne
children. She had red sandals on the feet, with little iron rings
on them as ornaments. All the under part of the body was
tattooed—this may be the sign of a foreign race; the nose also is
of a different stamp to those in Bari. The root of the nose is
certainly strongly depressed in these women, of whom I saw
yesterday also some specimens, so that it forms, with the arched
forehead, not an unpleasing waved line, terminating in a saucy
point, without the latter becoming a flat knob. If we could have
put into the mouth, where the four lower incisors also were
wanting, a ducat, or perhaps a dollar, the teeth would not then
have projected in the negro manner, and those blubber lips would
not have been at all noticed.</p>

<p>The skull, throughout Bari, is not generally pressed back like
that of animals, to the occiput, although the latter is strongly
developed. I find, however, no difference in the form of our
Egyptian thick heads directly they take off their tarbusch. The
<em>fluidum primordiale</em> of the Barian power of creation must
therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59_v2">[59]</span> have
worked, in this mountain-land, with the same noble power as that of
the land of Kashmire.</p>

<p>In other respects our queen was well formed, and the calves of
her legs projected tolerably stoutly over the iron rings. Even in
Germany she would have been considered one of the tallest of her
sex, and here also her size would be surprising if she wore a long
dress. She was at least five and a half Rhenish feet high, for she
looked very comfortably over my head. On this occasion I discovered
remains of ochre in her close-cut hair, a sign that she does not
use soap. Her name is Ishòk; she could scarcely keep herself from
laughing, and appeared to be very much flattered when she heard her
charming name repeated by us several times. Làkono and his queen
had brought a doll, representing a woman, hewn roughly from wood,
as a present, which turned out, contrary to our expectation, to be
only a doll; for they laughed immensely when we asked them whether
they worshipped or adored it as a deity.</p>

<p>We could not get a clear conception of their ideas of
religion—the less so, because the Tershomàn translating into Arabic
was a heathen Dinkaui. It seems that they worship a spirit of
nature, for we had been previously told that their god was grander
than the mast of our vessel. Whether they reverence him under a
tree, as the criminal court of Làkono seems to denote, is a
question I do not venture to decide. Horns, teeth, and amulets
point to some sort of worship.</p>

<p>Without troubling himself further with farewell ceremonies,
Làkono rose with his men; but his wife had previously looked at the
carpet, gave him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60_v2">[60]</span>
friendly dig in the ribs, and whispered a few words to him. The
great king did not wait for this being said twice; he seized the
end of the carpet, and gave it over, without further ceremony, to
the slave close at hand. This carpet belonged, however, to Rassulla
Effendi, who was the maùhn, or scribe, to Selim Capitan, and a
Persian by birth. He drew a long face on seeing these proceedings,
but was consoled with the promise of another new carpet, and the
whole thing was laughed at as an ingenious trick.</p>

<p>A panorama, to which, however, the neighbourhood of beautiful
mountain-forms lends the true charm, opens from the Island of
Tshànker. Opposite to us, on the right shore, we see the village of
Wuàlana, and before it lies a shallow island, called Koriana; on
the right shore lie, at a short distance from it, the villages of
Harikono and Amrit. The houses of the villages are tokuls, part of
them having higher pointed roofs. Shady trees stand around, and the
copsewood enjoys such a verdant life that we might fancy ourselves
in a northern region.</p>

<p>The mountains lie around in the following direction: Mount
Lof-et rises behind Mount Pelenjà, to S.E. by E., at a distance of
about four hours, like an isolated mountain of small height. Mount
Pelenjà, to S.E., in tolerable extent, from its peak about eight
hundred feet high, S.E., 60″ to S. and 75″ to E., some three hours
distant, a small mountain group of a rocky nature, and partly
wooded, completely secluded. The mountain chain of Logojà, where
cannibals dwell, the anterior peak of which seems to project to N.,
rises at a distance of from eight to nine hours, to a height like
that of the seven hills seen from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_61_v2">[61]</span> Cologne, with a lofty back, which appears,
so far as it is not concealed from the eye by the mountains lying
before it right and left, to extend from S.E. southerly 60″ long.
The Hill of Liènajin, or Linanzin, a gently rising rock, covered
with bushes, towards S.E. 50″ to S., distant an hour and a half.
The still smaller rocks of Arlu, to S.E. by S., two hours distant;
the rocks of Luluri or Lullulù to S.E. 30″ to S., one hour and a
half. In the S. rises Mount Lugi, smoothed at the top, with
precipitous disrupt walls of rock, which does not appear to exceed
Korèk in height, and may have six hundred feet relative height. The
river winds a little to the W. around its base, and this mountain
may once have formed a terrace, which has joined to the mountain
chain of Kàlleri, lying behind to S.S.E., forming as it were the
foot to the mass of mountains rising up in the S. We see on the
unevenly elevated rocky wall of Kàlleri, the dry bed of a cataract,
to which even the natives drew our attention.</p>

<p>COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT SHORE OF THE NILE FROM THE ISLAND OF
TSHANKER, TOWARDS SOUTH-EAST.—27TH JANUARY, 1841.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>All these mountains and rocky hills lie on the right side of the
river. This coincides with what has<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_62_v2">[62]</span> been said to us previously, and the
plastic formation of the mountains themselves shews that the river
does not break through from E. or S.E., and the natives are right
when they place the sources of the White Stream to the
<em>south</em>. On the left side of the river rises first, S.W. 3″
to W., Mount Lòngi, at two hours distant; Mount Lobèk, with a rocky
head S.W. 28″ to W., three hours; the flat, round Loffoni S.W. 30″
to W. four hours; Mount Bio S.W. 60″ to W., some eight hours
distant, ascending again to a considerable height; Mount Korèk,
already known to us, on the ground softly rising from the river; it
is one hour and a half from the river, entirely of a rocky nature,
intersected in manifold parts by steep disrupt walls of rocks,
similar to quarries. All its peaks not only lie in the distance,
where the whole mountain appears like a terrace, but also near at
hand, in equal horizontal lines, from W. to 75″ to N. It is perhaps
not more than six hundred feet high, and it is the mountain that
principally affords iron, although all the heights are said to
contain the same.</p>

<p>As I distinguished previously Mount Nerkanjin on the left side
of the Nile, by its height, so the mountains seem to increase
generally on this side in height, as also the country from the
shore to S.W. gradually ascends. Mount Konnopi or Kunobih appears
W. by N., at a distance of from nine to ten hours, of
light-coloured rocks, without any vegetation. It forms likewise a
mountain group, with its six or seven peaks, which fall away
tolerably steeply in convex lines, and separate one from the other.
The high points of this group are of equal form,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_63_v2">[63]</span> and may rise to two hundred
feet relative height. Behind this mountain and Korèk, a
mountain-chain projecting on both sides of Korèk, which stretches
itself for about an hour in length, extends in an undulating form,
and loses itself to S. This chain is called Kugelù, and I calculate
its distance at being at least twenty hours. To N.W. 73″ towards N.
lies Mount Lokùn, about two to two and a half hours distant, with a
gentle slope of small height, and to N. the Nerkanjin already known
to us, some eight to nine hours distant.</p>

<p>If we only consider the situation of these mountains generally,
and the evidence of the natives with reference to the origin of the
White Stream, who, from the moment that they stated the iron came
from the mountains in the south (where we had already hoped for
mountains), shewed their accurate knowledge of locality, and who
here, also, transfer the sources of the White arm of the Nile from
the foot of the mountain land <em>further to the south</em>, every
doubt must be removed by the agreement of these expressions. Even
among us the opinion was prevalent that the sources of the Nile
should be sought to the east in a ramification of the Abyssinian
chain of high mountains. We have therefore made close inquiries,
whether any <em>running water</em> were existing on this side, and
learned that there is not; for the people in that part, drink, on
the contrary, from <em>springs</em>. Nature seems here to have
formed, generally, to the east, as well as to the west, a
watershed.<a id="FNanchor_2v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2v2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64_v2">[64]</span>In S.E. Mount
Logojà is seen, at a distance of eight to nine hours, a chain of
mountains stretching from E. to S.; in the west rises Mount Kugelù,
twenty hours off, like a long serpentine track, which must be in
proportion to the presumed distance, as also its height to the near
rocky mountains of considerable elevation, and seems to extend
likewise to the south. Both mountain chains may, in consequence of
these exterior plastic proportions, rise up like branches to the
mighty trunk of mountains in the south, as the natives on the
Island of Tshànker endeavoured to shew me when I was sketching, by
uttering names and making unmistakable gestures. This
mountain-stock, perhaps a second Himalaya, may form the combination
of streams of the White Nile between these its sides. The river
here formerly broke violently through its projecting base—isolated
Mount Lugi, which is like a half demolished pyramid, and rushed
down over it like a powerful waterfall.</p>

<p>Selim Capitan made three observations upon the Island of
Tshànker, and the northern latitude was confirmed as 4° 30″. The
stream, having a direction to S.S.W., is found to be three hundred
mètres<a id="FNanchor_3v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_3v2" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> broad, from the island to the right shore. The
two arms of the river may amount to something over one hundred
mètres from the island to the left shore, before which another
little island lies. A rocky bar of gneiss extends here from E. to
W. right across the stream, and continues beyond the islands, the
highest points of which it forms, to the left shore, where we may
follow the traces of this rocky bank to a still greater distance,
for it projects in a slight breadth<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65_v2">[65]</span> over the ascending grounds. This reef,
running from E. to W. which may give the direction of the
succeeding chasms in the valley broken through by the stream, rises
in the middle of the river to a larger rock, and other blocks peep
out of the water towards the right shore, whilst the other rocky
part towards the Island of Tshànker is only superficially covered
by water. The current gushes by the before-named rocks as at the
Bingen Loch,<a id="FNanchor_4v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_4v2" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> and it is only there where we may expect to find
a passage.</p>

<p>Our Arabs are glad at this tschellàl, as they call a waterfall,
or even a current, and want to take it immediately for an
insurmountable wall, even before sounding the passage. The
conchylia, similar to oysters, clinging to these gneiss rocks, are
the thorn-muscles, which are found also at the cataracts in Nubia
(<i>Etheria tubifera</i>). By mistake, I previously called these
muscles <i>ampulla tubulosa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_5v2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5v2" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Besides the snails
mentioned on a former occasion, I found on the shores of the White
Stream the large water-snails (<i>ampullaria ovata var.</i>), as
well as the muscles (<i>Iridina rubens</i>, and <i>Anodonta
acuta</i>).</p>

<p>The specimens of sand I brought back with me, and which were
subjected to an examination in Berlin, with my other geognostical
collections, have been already defined by Dr. Girard, in C.
Ritters’ “Glance at the Source-Territory of the Nile.”</p>

<p>He says:—“A sand from the shore of the Bahr-el-Abiad, in the
kingdom of Bari, is similar to this sand (from the Sobàt river),
only a little coarser in the grain, which, however, is only at the
most of the size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66_v2">[66]</span>
of millet-grain: it contains principally quartz, but more mica than
the former, and has considerably more of those black grains, from
which we see that it is horn-blende. This is either derived from
syenite and diorite masses, as they often appear in gneiss and
mica-slate mountains, or they might be also of volcanic origin, for
the lava of the Gebl Defafaungh lying to the north boundary of
these plains, contains the same in great abundance.” With respect
to the constituent part of the rocks of this cataract, Dr. Girard
observes:—“It is gneiss, consisting of white feldspar, and a good
deal of white mica, and mica-slate, containing much granular,
brittle, white and yellow quartz, no feld-spar, and small scaly
black mica.”</p>

<p>The island of Tshànker, on which I planted a number of
palm-seeds, rises, with reference to the back of the surface of the
earth, fifteen feet high above the present water-mark. The natives
could not have been able to have sown the ground, which is strongly
mixed with sand, with the simsim (sesame), a grass particularly
requiring moisture, if the water of the swollen river had not
remained upon it for some time. In accordance with that, the chain
of mountains must have discharged an immense body of water during
the rainy season, for the island appears to me to lie somewhat
higher than either of the shores, and the high water overflows
therefore not only this island, but also a great part of the shores
which are separated about six hundred mètres from each other. From
this cause arise the beautiful green trees, and the verdant low
country lying back, from which ephemeral shallow lakes the water
seems to be drawn off by canals. Like Oases (Arabic Oà),
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67_v2">[67]</span> lie there in
a level land, which is parched up far and wide.</p>

<p>Legislation appears to be in a peculiar state in the country of
Bari. We were told that King Làkono slew criminals with his own
hand, by a thrust with a spear, and very quickly (goàm, goàm),
without any ceremonies; he sits under a large tree, with a heavy
spear in his hand, to pass judgment, and assumes a very angry look.
Perhaps the great spirit of the tree may inspire him on such a
presidency, or rather his own feeling of justice may cause this
righteous anger, and make him the supreme judge and executioner of
the misdoer, the latter being devoted also to death by the
unanimous will of the assembly. Priests or sorcerers do not appear
to be assembled at these public sittings in judgment, which remind
us of the ancient German institutions, because not a trace has been
found, so far as I know, of any such men among these people. The
great king, therefore, does not crack the criminal’s skull with the
club-sceptre he usually carries, as I imagined on his first visit;
but the very same views of a death without dishonour seem to
prevail here as among the Shilluks, who do not slay the Arabs taken
prisoners by them with the honourable spear, but beat them to death
like a dog with the hassaie.</p>

<p>The innate respect towards the king is, however, greater perhaps
than the royal power. This may mostly be reduced to the gigantic
limbs of his family and all his adherents, amongst whom the heads
of tribes subject to him, may be numbered, who stand around his
free stool as judges armed, although not voting, maintaining order,
and easily defeating his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_68_v2">[68]</span> solitary antagonists, with their heavy
sceptres of ebony, like constables’ staves.</p>

<p>It is evident that he has opponents, and indeed not a few, from
the circumstance that he requested us to shoot some people on the
left shore, because they were always making war on those of the
right shore. It might therefore seem quite right to him that
several of the inhabitants of that side were shot down a few days
ago, in so shameful a manner, from our vessels. His statements of
the hostile feelings of the men there does not appear, however, to
be founded on truth, for we have seen several times herds of cattle
swimming over from one shore to the other, without any robbery and
contention taking place in consequence. On a closer inquiry, his
main grievance was unbosomed; for two years he had <em>not</em>
received <em>anything</em> from the people of the left shore. This
was interpreted, consonant to Turkish views, to mean Tulba
(tribute); it seems to me, however, to denote rather a voluntary
contribution, because he complained at the same time, that he had
nothing to live upon, and therefore was not able to give us
anything.</p>

<p>King Làkono had a very sound understanding, and contrived
skilfully to evade the demand for meat, and the desire expressed to
visit him at his residence; for the Turks wanted to make a closer
inspection of his treasures, since gold was said to be among them.
He always affirmed that we should be obliged, in paying such a
return visit, to swim through a deep gohr, although we had been
previously told that he possessed a large and handsome sürtuk, in
which he plies far up and down the river. Our sandal, which
appeared to him probably more fitted<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_69_v2">[69]</span> for use than his own hewn-out trunk of a
tree, pleased him so well, that he asked it as a present. Of course
we were obliged to refuse him; for this little skiff was quite
indispensable to us for communication. It was promised that a far
handsomer vessel should be built for him at Marseilles—a white lie,
with which he did not seem to be content. It was tolerably plain,
from the badly translated expressions of these lords of Bari, and
still more from the far more intelligible language of signs, of
which they were not sparing, that they were perfectly conscious of
their superiority in force; for they signified, with ironical
laughter, that they could easily take our sandal by force, because
it was the smallest of our vessels.</p>

<p>Although Làkono seemed not to have expected such an answer from
us, and to be offended at it, yet he did not relinquish his plans
of conquest and booty, in which we were to assist him. He wished
not only to undertake a warlike expedition, in company with us, to
Berri, so rich in copper, but also to the neighbouring
mountain-chain of Logajà (also Lokonjà). The cannibals dwelling
upon this mountain—not known here, however, by the name of
Njam-Njam—had been long the subject of conversation among the crew.
According to what we heard from the natives below, these ill-famed
mountaineers had heads, and went on all-fours like dogs; this was
repeated also, even in Bari, probably from our misunderstanding the
language.</p>

<p>Captain Selim, the Muscovite, to whom courage could not be
denied in other respects, had, even in Khartùm, been wonderfully
afraid of these so-called Njam-Njams.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_70_v2">[70]</span> Now, however, he allowed his fear to mount
to a truly ridiculous height, probably because he was the most
corpulent of us all, except Selim-Capitan. He thought nothing less
than that he would be the first roast morsel which that savage
mountain-race would choose for a feast, on a favourable nocturnal
opportunity. Before the first expedition, my brother had designated
him a plump morsel (kabàb semmin) for the cannibals; and scarcely
was he summoned to this expedition than he inquired repeatedly and
anxiously about the existence and the abode of these men. This joke
was now haunting his brains, and particularly when his fat face was
lighted up by the enjoyment of araki, which he drank secretly in
his cabin, in order not to let the others partake of it. In such a
condition as this, he exhorted me to assist in urging as speedy a
return as possible; and, moreover, to think of my poor brother
Jussùf, who perhaps was ill.</p>

<p>Làkono, explained, on closer questioning, the ominous rumour of
the Anthropophagi, with dogs’ heads, and informed us that these bad
people have heads indeed, like others, but allow <em>all their
teeth</em> to remain in their head, and crawl <em>upon
all-fours</em> when they eat men. This means, perhaps, nothing more
than that they do not join in open combat with the inhabitants of
Bari, but crawl close to people, like dogs, plunder them, and
perhaps eat them. The Baghàras assert, that the same custom of
crawling, in marauding expeditions, exists among the Shilluks; and
our Circassians relate things, which are scarcely credible, of the
manner in which boys and girls are caught in their country.</p>

<p>It was <em>confirmed</em> here what we had
previously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71_v2">[71]</span> heard,
viz. that brothers do not marry sisters, nor fathers daughters;
they were indignant, and with reason, at such a question. The bride
is purchased from the father for sixty to seventy oxen: this price
might be called dear, in spite of the numerous herds of cattle
here; yet it counteracts polygamy and the enfeeblement of race
thereby produced, as much as the forbidding of marriage among blood
relations. The release of a prisoner costs only thirty oxen, whence
we might conclude that their wars, which they appear to carry on
only by the river’s side, are not very barbarous. Besides, their
spears confirm this supposition, for they are ground off to a
smooth edge, and have no barbs such as those of the people of the
mountains in these regions, and in the land of Sudàn.</p>

<p>The spears with barbs found amongst them, have been either
received in exchange, having been thrown by the mountaineers in the
mutual feuds, or they have been forged by themselves for the chase,
to cast at the wild deer when they hunt them to death. The
poisoning of arrows, with their various barbs, is certainly against
this humane view of the character of the people. They warned us of
poison every time we purchased arrows, yet I found a quantity among
them not poisoned. It may therefore be usual to use the latter only
in war, because otherwise they would poison their spears; whilst
they shoot the deer with the former, without the poison perhaps
exercising any effect when the flesh is eaten—as Shömburg says, is
also the case in Guiana. They bury their dead in a recumbent
posture, and far away from their huts or tokuls.</p>

<p>According to Làkono and his relations, the rainy<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_72_v2">[72]</span> season will set in, in
<em>two months</em> from the present time, (therefore at the end of
March, or beginning of April.) This appears, in truth, somewhat
late: for the two arms of the Nile, near Khartùm, begin to ascend
nearly simultaneously on the 2nd or 3rd of May, and it is
impossible that even one drop of these first rains in the high
land, which the thirsty soil, moreover, immediately absorbs, and
which are swallowed up by a course in a long valley-land, should
reach Khartùm from hence in so short a time. The regions lying
lower, and subject to the tropical rains, are the cause perhaps of
the first swellings to the White Stream; for, before all those
numerous low grounds and shallow lakes are full, the eventual
connections with the more distant inner waters, are restored and
overflow. Much more time is required for this than for the effusion
of the mountain waters, near the sloping rocky ground lying before
us.</p>

<p>If we should not, however, take the nearer district of the
tropical rains as an explanation of the simultaneous swelling of
both arms of the Nile near Khartùm, we could not explain this
phenomenon, for the mountain waters of the White Stream must,
though with a far slower course, make three times as long a way as
those of the Blue Nile, in just the same time. A difference is
consequently seen at Khartùm at high water, which, however, soon
becomes equal, from the mutual pouring into each other of the arms,
or by the damming up of the tributary streams.</p>

<p>Fadl is my faithful confidant in purchasing the curiosities of
the country; he is slow and painstaking in a negotiation, when I
immediately lose my patience.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_73_v2">[73]</span> He first, for a long time, squats, as he
used to do in the land of Sudàn, with the people here; plays with
the glass beads,—holds the larger ones by themselves against the
light, as if they were jewels; and the good Ethiopians become so
confident and longing, that they can hold out no longer; and then
he is very slow in giving any, so that the value increases in their
eyes. They are not only, as I have before said, very mistrustful in
this barter, but also so undecided, like children, that beads and
goods are often given away and returned. I have some hopes that my
Ethnographical collection will increase considerably in this manner
during the return voyage, for we have already exchanged many
weapons and other things.</p>

<p>The spears of this country are distinguished by a greater
elegance in the workmanship, and do not exceed the length of the
gigantic bodies of these men. With the exception of a few, they are
javelins, seven feet long, with a shaft of the thickness of a
thumb. The shaft of bamboo is encircled entirely, or partly, with a
narrow band of iron, or with the skins of snakes and land
crocodiles, and the lower end surrounded with an iron knob and
single rings, in order that the spear may have the proper
equilibrium in the hand when it is hurled. About half a foot from
the end it is generally furnished with a tuft of fur, which seems
to stand in the place of a <em>feathered</em> arrow, a weapon never
seen here. The iron of the head is one and a half to two feet long,
the back flat, and the knob has four little bosses.</p>

<p>The bows are from five and a half to six and a half feet long,
of bamboo, and encircled in the same<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74_v2">[74]</span> manner; the strings are made from the
inner bark of trees. The arrows are very neatly wrought, have
barbs, and are two and a half to three feet long.</p>

<p>The harpoons employed against crocodiles and hippopotami, have,
with the short point, which has only one barb, a length of thirteen
to fourteen feet. The shank, of bamboo, is an inch and a half
thick, and is not fastened to the point (neither are the shafts to
the beads of lances, so that it comes off in launching the harpoon.
The point itself remains by a long thin line made of bark, in the
possession of the fisherman, and is always visible to him at the
end by a float of ambak wood, until the animal struck has exhausted
its rage; and then, sitting in his hewn-out trunk of a tree
(sürtuk), he takes the line in his hand, and with a spear attacks
the exhausted beast as it comes up to the surface for air, until it
bleeds to death.</p>

<p>The ivory rings, two of which are often seen on the upper part
of each arm, are two pounds and upwards in weight; the fluted clubs
of ebony are two to three pounds. The knives are crooked, rounded
at the top, and half a foot long, with a handle one and a half or
less in length. The people procure the materials for their
beautiful works in iron from Mount Korèk, in the tanks and gohrs of
which iron is said to be found, like sand, in immense quantities.
They brought me a little basket full of this coarse-grained black
mineral, and with it a few scoriæ. According to Marian, the men
smelt in earthen pots; for furnaces and such like are as little to
be looked for here as in Kordofàn.</p>

<p>This is pure magnet-iron, which, as my Nuba thinks, they free
from the larger stones, and then<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_75_v2">[75]</span> shake in a sieve, to free it from the fine
rocky sand. Girard says that this magnet-iron shews also, in
several places, specular-iron, and recalls to mind similar
appearances in the great Mica slate chain of mountains of the
Brazils. The specimens of stones procured from Mount Korèk, through
the natives, were of a reddish coarse-grained granite, although we
had expected gneiss from thence, having found it near and upon the
island of Tshanker. Yet I would not be certain that these specimens
were not taken from some other mountain. What rich results might
ensue from an examination of these mountains!</p>

<p><span class="sc">26th</span> and <span class="sc">27th
January</span>.—King Làkono, notwithstanding his complaisance in
other respects, is proud in this single instance: he will not go on
board any <em>other</em> vessel than that of Selim Capitan’s, much
as Arnaud wishes it, who promises us a great <em>fête</em> when we
shall bring this to pass. Selim Capitan passes with him for a matta
enjoying the same privileges as himself, because he has our
treasures, glass ornaments, and clothes, in his keeping, and
distributes them <em>ad libitum</em>, with the consent of Suliman
Kashef.</p>

<p>The island of Tshanker, called also Riëm to Selim Capitan in my
presence (perhaps the name of the second and smaller island), has
become, since our abode here, a market for barter. A great crowd of
people is always collected here, and Selim Capitan considers it
advisable to give them a taste of the effect of a gun. He therefore
shot a bull while running, twice in the head; unfortunately the
balls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77_v2">[77]</span> did not
pierce through, and therefore the beast staggered, but did not
fall. Hereupon Selim held the barrel behind the animal’s ear, and
the bull fell; the people, indeed, drew back astonished, but the
excessive fear of fire-arms appears, since our short stay, to be at
an end in the more civilised state of Bari.</p>

<p>I was the cause of presents being made to Làkono, for future
sowing of maize, and a better kind of durra, Ommòs (Egyptian peas),
and the so-called horse-beans, (called by the Arabs, Ful, and a
very nourishing favourite food of theirs,) beside many other
fruits. He seemed to me to be a man who would take care to sow
them, for he planted even the stones of the dates which he had
eaten with us. If the dates in these warmer regions should ever
come up, the whole crew, without meaning it, have contributed to
plant them, because they threw away the stones of the dates they
ate on all the landing-places. I doubt, however, if dates will ever
thrive, because the doum-palms have a very stunted appearance in
the lower countries of the White Stream, and for a long time have
entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>As the vine thrives in Sennaar, it might grow also here, and I
should have gained immortal fame if I had not unfortunately
forgotten, in Khartùm, the layers of vines I had determined to take
with me. Merissa is also not unknown here, as the black soldiers
told me, who had drank it, and found it equally good as that of
Sennaar. <em>Beer</em> was known even to the ancient Egyptians:
what is now prepared in Egypt under the name of Busa, from wheat
(kamm) is bad and pappy; in Nubia, Belled-Sudàn, we get it
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78_v2">[78]</span> better quality,
made from durra, and called generally merissa: the same is also
quite a common drink in this country. Beer appears, consequently,
to be generally indigenous where agriculture takes place, and where
wine has not received the preference due to it.</p>

<p><em>28th January.</em>—Nature has drawn here a real bar of rocks
through the White Stream, which we dare not venture to surmount;
for the water has fallen, for some days, as is quite evident, and
the vessels could only, by taking out all their freight, pass the
defile near the large rocks, which is called on this account, bab,
or gate. The river-bed beginning from hence, appears to be
generally of a more rocky nature, for we perceive, even from the
rocks on the Island of Tshanker, breakers in the stream up the
river: however, there is no doubt, that we might sail away
victoriously over these obstacles at the time of the inundation,
for the river here rises to about eighteen feet high. The main
thing would be, then, for north winds to blow exactly at this
period, strong enough to withstand the pressure of water rising in
this mountain-land; for I am still of opinion that the rapidity of
the current increases from hence in such a manner, that we could
not advance by the rope even with the best will. We have remained
here at the island three entire days, and the <em>ne plus
ultra</em> is not so much inscribed on the Pillars of Hercules in
the water, as desired in the hearts of the whole expedition.</p>

<p>The war-dance, which the blacks performed yesterday, has
contributed certainly to the final determination to return. Even I
thought yesterday that I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_79_v2">[79]</span> heard and saw in the fearful battle-song,
a declaration of war, and a challenge to the contest. It was almost
impossible to persuade oneself that it was merely a mark of honour.
The natives marched up and down the island, in columns, brandishing
their lances in the air, sang their war-songs with threatening
countenances and dreadful gestures, then fell into still greater
ecstasy, ran up and down, and roared their martial chant.
Nevertheless I altered my opinion that this was done with hostile
views, for the native interpreters remained quietly with us on
board the vessel; and when we sent them to request that this honour
might not be paid to us, they returned, though not having effected
our object.</p>

<p>It was thought advisable that we should leave the shore, for the
natives had only need spring down to be on board our vessels. There
were certainly too many black people, and a warlike rapacious
enthusiasm might easily, it was true, possess their minds, inflamed
as they were by the military manœuvres. It was well, therefore,
that a reiterated request on our side was answered, and an end put
to the warlike ceremony, without our having betrayed our fear, by
pushing off from the shore.</p>

<p>I remained this night on board Selim Capitan’s vessel, to induce
him to <em>renew</em> the examination of the rocky pass in the
water, and to allow me to accompany him; but he declared to me,
although he could not conceal his own nervousness, that not only
the Frenchmen, but also Suliman Kashef, even if the latter told me
the contrary, have determined not to proceed further. I knew
therefore how to explain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_80_v2">[80]</span> why Selim Capitan and Arnaud had gone
alone to the rocky pass, without letting me know of their
intention, although the spot to be explored, where a passage
possibly might be made, was scarcely a gun-shot distance from us. I
felt myself, however, too much weakened from my illness to swim to
it, and to scale the rocks, for I would not ask the favour of the
sandal. My servants, who wished as much as myself to proceed
further, had been at the place; and Fadl, who had been previously a
mariner himself, declared that we could certainly pass through, but
not back again, if the water continued to fall so much as it has
done now for some days.</p>

<p>Selim Capitan was really inclined to explore the ascent, but
this continuation of the voyage was not to last longer than a day.
But when he knelt this morning on his carpet, before sun-rise,
directing his face to the East, for prayer, and discerned the
numerous fires on the right shore, which he had not remarked during
his ablutions, he looked at me so mournfully and suspiciously, that
I could scarcely restrain my laughter. He concluded his prayer; and
now he saw also on the island of Tshanker, near us, a number of
such little straw fires, over which the naked people were warming
themselves; whilst nearly every single man was stretching out his
long legs over his own little fire. Then his courage sank anew, for
there were still more blacks than yesterday.</p>

<p>These men, however, did not come empty-handed, and barter rose
to a pitch of greatness and variety, such as we had not before
seen—a quantity of fowls, goats, sheep, cows and calves, wood,
ferruginous sand, and iron dross, tobacco, pipes, simsim, durra,
weapons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81_v2">[81]</span> all kinds
of ornaments for the body—everything for beads. Nevertheless the
good Ethiopians did not shew themselves to-day quite blameless, for
they sold quivers full of arrows, many of which were without
points. They delivered the wares while receiving the beads, or the
seller ran hastily away, retaining the goods as well as the
purchase-money; they cuffed and wrestled with our men, without,
however, making use of their weapons. On the whole, however, the
injustice was on our side; the drum therefore beat to recall the
crew to the vessels.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the day, about two o’clock, when Selim
Capitan, in order to take his leave, and to employ the dreaded
people at the moment of our departure, and keep them far from us,
threw ten cups of sug-sug on shore, and the cannons on all the
vessels were discharged, to bid solemn farewell with twenty-one
shots to the beautiful country which must contain so many more
interesting materials. The forty or forty-two days lost by Arnaud’s
fault, in Korusko, are again recalled to my mind. If we had arrived
here twenty days previously, neither would all these rocks have
been an obstacle, nor would there have been a pretext for not
proceeding further; and it would have been no absolute misfortune,
supposing that in our <em>return</em> we had not been able
immediately to sail over this reef of rocks.</p>

<p>Rain begins here, as I have already said, in two months’ time.
On its setting in, the neighbouring masses of rocks discharge their
water into the river-bed; the river rises after a few days, and it
would not be difficult, therefore, at the expiration of that time,
to pass the rocky bar. But against the proposal<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_82_v2">[82]</span> to wait for the rainy season,
the objection, partly founded in fact, was offered, that the
provisions which had been provided for ten months, would not
suffice for the return voyage. Certainly the provisions had been
shamefully dealt with, and there was little to be expected from the
people of this country, who would be paid for every thing. It is
just as clear that the natives do not cultivate agriculture beyond
their immediate necessities, and therefore have stored up no
magazines, as that their herds are only sufficient for their
consumption, because, had it been otherwise, the Sultan, leaving
aside the people, must have shewn himself more liberal. It is
certain also, that with the hitherto lavish profusion of
glass-beads, their value must infallibly decrease, and that
therefore we shall soon be in want of this means of payment.</p>

<p>The principal reason, however, of my proposal not meeting with
favour, appears to me to lie in this, that a sudden attack by the
natives was feared, and not entirely without justice, on a longer
and closer acquaintance, by which our supremacy, at all events,
must suffer; because Turks wish always to remain Turks, that is,
born lords of the earth. As a last resource I rely upon a third
expedition, and this thought afforded me also some consolation.</p>

<p>The water has diminished to a remarkable degree. Close to the
first island, which is next to the left shore, we ran aground, and
now we have been squatting for several hours near the second
island, lying at the left shore. All “lissa” and “ela” cannot bring
us from the spot, although the men, who are trying to raise the
vessel in the water, have rested twice from exhaustion. The
negroes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83_v2">[83]</span> indeed,
approach us and laugh, but they may wish, notwithstanding, to
assist us; yet it appears advisable to keep them at a distance by
firing, so that they may not remark the impotency of a vessel when
stranded. I here count, from the deck, eight villages on the rising
ground of the left shore; on the right, lying more level with the
water-line, only two. The sun sinks behind Mount Korèk, and we hope
to work ourselves off this time. This may be a difficult return
voyage, for we have many shallow places to pass, and the water
continues to fall. We are again afloat at sunrise.</p>

<p>Behind the last-mentioned island we remark another little one;
then we pass between two islands, for this voyage by the left shore
is of a very complicated nature. We are scarcely off before the
vessel immediately again sticks fast, and whirls round like a top.
We proceed down the river close to the left shore, the negroes
throwing stones at us; we know not whether they are in jest or in
earnest. To be sure, we did not conduct ourselves in a very
friendly manner, in our ascent by the <em>left</em> shore, having
killed there eleven people, and certainly wounded many more. These
are the republicans, who would not recognise King Làkono; they
laugh at the threats of the crew, until Feïzulla Capitan orders his
pistols to be brought, so that he might intimidate them. We shoal
again, work ourselves clear, but cannot reach the other vessels,
where Làkono is said to be on board Selim Capitan’s. It seems that
the good king will regain, by our presence, his authority, which
has been considerably diminished by the withdrawal of the subsidy,
or Tulba, over these people on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_84_v2">[84]</span> the left shore, who are to give us,
according to his promise, several cows.</p>

<p>I cannot yet recover; but just at this moment, when the vessel
has turned to the north, in the direction of my brother, I resign
myself, with pleasure, to the idea of remaining with Làkono,
learning the language, and collecting the necessary information,
making myself useful in extending the knowledge of economical and
technical sciences, and taking part in their military expeditions,
wherein I should have formed a fearful <em>avant garde</em> with my
three servants, who were of the same inclination as myself, owing
merely to our fire-arms;—and thus to become of the most vital
importance to the next expedition, and to be able to return with
it.</p>

<p>Selim Capitan communicated to me, in confidence, that the French
heroes want to visit Mount Korèk, here from the left shore, and
that Arnaud has applied for an escort of ten soldiers. This
intended excursion had been kept secret from me; either I was
considered too weak, as perhaps really was the case or no German
witnesses were wished to oppose, as they very certainly would have
done, any future charlatanry. I had full satisfaction, however,
when I recommended, in presence of Arnaud, a visit to the
iron-mines of Korèk as being perfectly necessary. The crafty Selim
Capitan said, that he had spoken to Suliman Kashef, and that a
hundred chosen men, as an escort, were placed at disposal for this
laudable visit. This offer of increased protection produced a
peculiar effect in Arnaud’s countenance, and he muttered a curse
between his teeth, although I declared that I could not be of the
party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85_v2">[85]</span>What I said was
meant in earnest, for I must have been carried, owing to the want
of beasts of burden; and besides, I did not dare at all to expose
my worthy head to the sun’s rays, because, from having remained
under it, I had still the feeling as if my hair stood erect, like a
conductor of caloric, by every single ray. Mount Korèk will,
therefore, for the present, not be explored by me.</p>

<p>I must take advantage of this opportunity to mention a
circumstance which may explain my not very great friendship for
Arnaud, abstractedly from his general arrogance. Selim Capitan
confirmed what the merchant Olivi had communicated to me in
Khartùm. My fellow-travellers, in order to make themselves secure
against any control, had determined, under the presidency of
Vaissière, <em>not to mention my worthy name at all in their
journals</em>. But the honest Vaissière had, at the same time,
another plan, which was no other than to <em>exclude</em> me from
the expedition. He himself offered to provide the biscuit necessary
for me and my three servants. This proposal was the more acceptable
to me, because all the baking-ovens of Khartùm had been taken
possession of by the Government, to provide for the crew of the
expedition.</p>

<p>The biscuit arrived safely the day before our departure at my
house, just as Doctor Count de Domine, having returned from
Kordofàn, was present. Without further investigation, I took the
contents and weight to be correct, but my Italian friend thought
that Vaissière was a great “baron fututto,” and opened a sack, from
which an excellent biscuit peeped forth smilingly. This, however,
did not convince him long; I was obliged to order Fadl, who
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86_v2">[86]</span> standing by,
to shake out the bag, and then a peal of laughter resounded on
every side. Only the uppermost part of the sack was laid over with
good biscuit, the lower part being full of spoiled and mouldy ones.
The very same result followed with the other sacks.</p>

<p>Armed with my heavy iron stick, I immediately ran along the side
of the water to the divan of Vaissière, where I found all the
Frenchmen assembled. I said plainly that he wished to force me, by
this rascally deception, to desist from the voyage after one or two
days’ further progress. In conclusion, I called him a slave-dealer,
whose cross of the legion of honour I would tear off; and when he
talked of being an officer, and “honour!” I called him a cowardly
rascal. None of the Europeans spoke a word in his defence; and I
was able to retreat through the numerous attendants, who feared my
iron club as well as the Basha; and I went to the governor, who
gave orders that the needful biscuit should be provided me from the
shune.</p>

<p>Once again, before my departure, Vaissière and I stood suddenly,
man to man, on a narrow path by the Blue Nile, where, from fear,
because he had not challenged me, or lest I should push him into
the water, he only stammered out the words, “Wife and children!” In
these countries one must either let oneself be trod under foot, and
be able to turn and cringe, or must step forward, like a man in his
natural state, breast to breast.</p>

<p><em>29th January.</em>—Before sunrise we hoist the anchor from
the middle of the river, where we had halted for safety during the
night, and set sail in a northern direction. Some elephant-trees,
with thick foliage,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87_v2">[87]</span> and two villages, are on the left side of
the shore, and a shallow long isle, like all the islands of this
region. On the right Mount Pelenja, as well as an isle, which
another larger one immediately follows. We see two magnificent
broad-leaved acacia-trees, to which several more of these beautiful
round-headed trees join on directly, and habitations right and
left. The sun rises behind clouds. We row E.N.E., and then E. by N.
The right shore forms a long durra-field; in its neighbourhood we
get aground, and in spite of every exertion, remain fixed until
half past nine o’clock. The strong north wind drives our vessel
about in all directions, and the tired rowers are no match for my
bold countryman. At half past ten o’clock we arrive, in an easterly
direction, at the shallow island, separated from the right shore by
a narrow arm of the Nile, and lying on a level with it. This
island, planted with durra, is the very same one where King Làkono
first visited us.</p>

<p>We have the other vessels ahead, waiting for us, and we come up
to them at eleven o’clock, with great difficulty; for the men can
display but little vigour at the rope in the water. The negroes of
the right shore pursue us with several bundles of wood, to sell to
us. Feïzulla Capitan is ashamed to make his report, on account of
his long delay, and therefore lies down to sleep. We cast anchor
also in the middle of the river; for we trust the natives no
longer, and fear the wrath of the great Matta.</p>

<p>King Làkono sits on the shore in the centre of his people, who
are standing around him; his favourite wife is also standing, and
only one of his brothers is sitting near him. I now hear that
Làkono had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88_v2">[88]</span> asked
Selim Capitan for a musket to shoot the cannibals. The latter
feared that the Tubal Cain of Bari might establish a manufactory of
guns, and then come as a great conqueror to Sennaar, and therefore
flatly refused him. On this account his Majesty is angry, and will
not come on board. I am particularly sorry that he does not take
leave of us, for I had noted down several questions which I should
like to ask him. A drummer close to him is beating very skilfully,
from time to time, on his long wooden kettle-drum, and answers
quite doughtily the roll of one of our drummers. Another is blowing
a wooden trumpet, in which the mouth-piece, or the hole at the
upper end, is like that of a flute. They have also a twisted
antelope’s horn, from which they manage to elicit several
notes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the violent north wind, we set out again at
half-past one o’clock, without even thinking of a visit of
reconciliation to Làkono. What can the man think of us now? We who
have got so many weapons, spears, bows, and clubs, from his people,
and who certainly, in his eyes, have equally as many guns, do not
give him even a single musket! We row at first, but soon tiring of
this work, the vessels are allowed to drift with the stream, “Allah
kerim,” and be tossed by the wind wherever it may drive them. We
therefore knock one against the other, run towards the shore, and
go, to my extreme anger, down the river with the stern foremost
instead of the bow. This does not seem to Feïzulla Capitan to be
any disgrace. To the right shore a shallow island, partly
cultivated, and having, at the extremity of its foot, a little
village. Another, upon which are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_89_v2">[89]</span> several cows, who have only to thank the
strong wind that we did not carry away some of them, stretches far
downwards for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>Here I must express my surmise that the natives cultivate
cotton, although not, perhaps, in large quantities. On the island
of Tshanker I had seen already cotton offered for sale, without its
existence being a matter of surprise to me; for I had previously
met with it in the forests on the White Stream, growing wild. I am
in possession even of a specimen of the cotton of this country, and
know now how to explain from what the rahàt is made, which I got on
that island. I was sitting once on the island of Tshanker, and
sketching, when a young woman stationed herself at some distance,
and pointed to her neck, which she wished to adorn with beads. I
presented her with some to look at, and gave her to understand by
dumb-show, that I wanted to have her thread apron for them. When I
stepped nearer, however, to make the thing more intelligible to the
woman, she drew back timidly. I therefore beckoned to Fadl, because
he has more patience, and a darker colour, which must inspire
greater confidence. She was no longer afraid when he came, but
stopped and gave her consent to the sale by signs, although the men
standing in the neighbourhood threatened her by elevating their
spears. She motioned to Fadl to remain where he was, ran away, and
soon returned with a leathern apron, which she had fetched from
behind a rock, whereon men were standing.</p>

<p>Without troubling herself further about their threatening
attitudes and words, she waded, with a true contempt of death, up
to her breast in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90_v2">[90]</span> water, and came out again with the rahàt
in her hand, and the leathern apron round her loins. She still paid
no regard to the continued threatening motions of the men, but gave
the rahàt over to Fadl, took the few beads, and ran away in the
greatest joy. This rahàt was twisted together very artistically of
cotton threads, shaped, as I have already related, and coloured red
with ochre.</p>

<p>Four o’clock. Our course which, judging from the situation of
the mountains, had been north-westerly since half-past one o’clock,
now changes,—without, however, our being able to define it
distinctly. Half-past five o’clock. This is the first moment that
we can say we are going N. by E. These things must be experienced:
to be ill with Turks—to make campaigns and journeys with Turks—and
to undertake a voyage of discovery on the White Stream with such a
fleet!</p>

<p>The vessels, according to their different sizes, ran on the
sand-bank; first forwards, then backwards,—now right, now left. To
navigate with the stern foremost is the favourite custom; the
sparks of the fire fall through the open hatchway, before the
half-broken door of the powder-room, and whizz in the water of the
lower hold! At last, by energetic threats, I wake Feïzulla Capitan
from his dreadful apathy. The fire is extinguished, and the stern
of the vessel, after a great deal of talking about the disgrace to
a naval officer educated in England, turned to the proper
direction, with the assistance of the oars.</p>

<p>I saw five large and small islands, but whether they lie nearest
to the right or to the left shore, I know as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_91_v2">[91]</span> little as upon what shore the isolated
villages and tokuls stand. It was really enough to drive one mad to
see the sailors so often apply themselves to the oars when the wind
had turned the vessel, which they regard as a piece of floating
wood, towards the mountains. I shall, at last, be confused myself
in such a disgusting hurly-burly. Six o’clock. On the left, a
little island; soon afterwards, on the right, a larger one,
separated from the right shore by a narrow arm. Then a village,
close upon the same shore, pleasingly enlivened by men and cows,
immediately appears. Single trees extend behind it, and give a
picturesque effect to the whole. On the left, our old acquaintance,
Mount Nerkanjin, steps forward again, and surpasses, at least,
considerably in height, the mountains lying nearer. At half-past
six o’clock we go to the N., with small deviations to one side or
the other, and come to three islands, following close behind one
another, along the right shore, and anchor, when it becomes dark,
before seven o’clock, below the last one.</p>

<p><em>30th January.</em>—A very strong wind all night; the vessels
lying awkwardly near each other, beat their heads and knock their
ribs together, so that it was quite pleasant to behold it. Every
one slept and snored around me, and I also would not allow myself
to be disturbed any more, and did not wake the capitan; but looked,
however, twice through the open hatchway into the hold, to see if
the water were increasing. This morning there was only one vessel
at the anchorage; all the others were scattered far and wide down
the river. Immediately after sunrise we set out towards N. On the
right a wood extends;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_92_v2">[92]</span> on the left, solitary beautiful trees
rise; but few people are to be seen.</p>

<p>Two little islands are at the right shore; the one lying deeper
rises from the water like an elevated green shield. The beautiful
forest of the right side condensates and strengthens; on the left,
also, the trees approach closer together. The country rises here,
and we look far over the left shore into the land, as into an
orchard, with villages. We halt at the shield-island, on the sand,
and look around us for another water-track. With much difficulty we
work through between the green reed island and another one, and
land at our old little isle, where we made the acquaintance of the
chief Nalewadtshòhn on the 22nd January. We had half an hour’s
barter; then we push off, and navigate with the bow of our vessel
directed towards the first of the two islands lying one behind the
other, at the left shore, as if we would have caused there an
earthquake. The vessel turns, and we go now again with the stern
forward, as generally happens upon the Nile, in order to let the
vessels drift free from danger, for the helm then becomes the
scenting-nose of the shallows, and stops also, in fact, on
them.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock we halt at the left shore. I get here a
harpoon among other curiosities of the country. Unfortunately, we
now hurry through this beautiful region without taking any further
notice of the land or the people; for the want of sufficient
water-course, and the ignorance of it, drives us to make as much
haste as possible to the friendly Elliàbs, where we intend to stop
and caulk the vessels. I have never remarked persons lying ill, and
diseases may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93_v2">[93]</span> be
generally rare among these people of nature; when they do come on,
perhaps they are mostly fatal. At nine o’clock we are off again,
and have, immediately on our right, two little green islands, and a
village on the shore. Another entanglement of vessels, so that it
is a complete disgrace!</p>

<p>The water, pouring out vigorously from a gohr of the right
shore, is muddy, and appears to come from a lake, the water of
which is let off for the sake of catching fish. On the left a green
island, with high reeds; on the right a wood, wherein there are
several bare and withered trees. The land appears here to be quite
uncultivated. Our vessel at last goes again properly, for Selim
Capitan, whom the other vessels are trying to keep in sight,
outstrips us by the stroke of the oars. The reed-island is followed
by another one after some paces. The shores are arid on both sides;
we cannot look over them at the scenery beyond, because the water
is considerably lower than when we ascended. In the middle of the
river a narrow island, green with reeds, behind which, on the right
shore, a large village is remarked, with broad tokuls, as well as
herds of cows at the water. These tokuls are open behind, and the
young cattle appear to be penned in them. Down at the village
another island lies, of about a quarter of an hour in length. On
the right and left, scanty wood is developing itself thickly behind
the shores. An islet, of three to four paces broad, and twelve to
fifteen long, has planted itself here boldly in the river. Either
this island is quite new, and will increase in time, or it is the
remains of an old one. Immediately behind, an elevated green shield
floats again towards us. We navigate<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94_v2">[94]</span> at the right shore to N.E., and shall go
again soon to N.</p>

<p>The beauty of the country has unfortunately again descended to
the old uniformity, with the horizontal position of the flat
country; before us lies an island like a Delta; it is already
partly dry, and we pass by its left side. But stop! Every one
fetches up, and we shall be obliged perhaps to work over to the
right side. Ten o’clock, N. by E.; we row bravely against the N.E.
wind. The shores of the stream are flat and low; by the sand lying
thereon, we see that the river at its side flows over them. An arid
island at the left shore is divided by a dry gohr. On the right, a
village is suddenly disclosed, with broad tokuls, and negroes
expecting treasures. Upon the island, also, they stride stoutly in
close to the ships, but no beads are handed to them. The men of the
oxen-village point to their herds, but their benevolent offer is in
vain.</p>

<p>We remark, as usual, among the light-coloured cows, many quite
white, and few black or dapple. The bulls have the customary high
and thick hump; the cows, on the contrary, have exactly the
appearance of those at Emmerich on the Rhine; their horns are
twisted in a surprisingly handsome form, and set off with flaky
hair, as well as the ears. They carry the latter erect, by which
means the head, and the lively eye, acquire a brisk and intelligent
expression. We have an island of about a quarter of an hour in
length at our right; the oars rest in consequence of a stronger
current, and we go N.E. Half past eleven o’clock. On the left a
green island, of the length of half an hour, before which we again
get aground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95_v2">[95]</span>
without our intellectual commanders being disturbed by it. We stop
at the right shore, to make our midday halt, but Suliman Kashef
pushes off again, although he is the man who takes most care about
the distribution of the meat, and we others follow amidst the
murmurs of the crew.</p>

<p>After we had left on our right two islands, we halt at the foot
of the second one, at about three o’clock, with the same intention.
The shallow island is only elevated a little above the level of the
water, of a sandy nature, but full of a species of large and small
grass, conclusive of the splendid pastures of the surrounding
country, of which the herds afford the best proof. We navigate
further, and have immediately a small island on our right. For
amusement we go awhile upon the sand, soon get off again, and have
on the left another island with shallow sand-heads at the side. The
whole left shore lies flat, and makes its appearance beautifully
wooded; over it Mount Nerkanjin, concealed in mist and by the
distance, rises to the west. I take leave of it and of all the
mountains, which are so delightful to my heart, and have
contributed so much to my convalescence by their fresh air, and by
bringing before me pictures of home. We go to the north. A poor
little hamlet, surrounded and shaded by trees, on the left shore.
Right and left the vessels squat, and accident alone makes us take
the middle road. At the right, two small islands, distinguished, as
usual here, by nothing except their succulent grass or reeds. Yet
our vessel, proud at the start already gained, goes smack on the
flat left shore, as if Nature did not shew shallows there to the
most inexperienced mariner. One shock, and—we stick fast. Once more
tokuls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96_v2">[96]</span> peep
through the trees of the left shore at some distance; negroes are
collecting on the shore.</p>

<p>We are navigating through a tract of countries, touching whose
original formation and populations we exhaust ourselves in
fruitless conjectures. Monuments do not tell us, history is silent,
and the annals of the people live only in meagre traditions, which
may possibly extend to two or three generations. We could not learn
any thing even of these, and the past is repeated in a perpetual
present. We throw a sorrowful glance at the youth of these nations,
and do not understand how it happens that a people could always
remain <em>young</em>.</p>

<p>The other vessels pass us, whilst we are calling, “Eh lissa!”
Most of the men are only seemingly exerting themselves in the
water, to hoist the vessel, without answering the Abu Hashis
passing by and mocking at us. The natives must love the shade, for
they remain with their wives under the trees. The shaven heads, and
mostly turned in noses of the latter seem to do homage to the
principle of beauty being in man. If this decided type of the
feminine formation of countenance afford the plastic proof of the
primitive natural distinction of the sexes, then not woman, but
man, stands here as the master-piece of Nature, similar to what is
generally the case in the animal creation. Woman is the weaker
being in such a state of nature as this,—the beast of burden, in
whom the germ for the improvement of the character is suppressed,
though it must be considered as her inalienable birthright.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour, we work ourselves off, and row, as
fast as our bodies, dripping with perspiration,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_97_v2">[97]</span> will allow us, in order to
gain a deeper water-course. On the left we notice a forest-hamlet,
and on the right an island, which is a quarter of an hour in
length. Another island ends, the upper part of which I had not
remarked. A long bright water-basin, from the back ground of which
two little islands, like green hills, cheerfully look up, stretches
before us in N.N.E. The negroes dance and jump no more; they stand
melancholy on the shore, because they lose their glass-bead
men.</p>

<p>Half-past three o’clock. After the lapse of some minutes we
navigate through a narrow canal, and leave the broad water on our
right behind the island close to us. At the end of this island we
first drive furiously against the shore, and then against another
vessel, so that there is cracking and breaking aloft, and a flood
of curses discharged. The men jump into the water, bawl, and make a
row on all sides, to push the vessels off the sand. We get loose,
have an island immediately before us, and try to go into the narrow
arm, which separates it from the right shore. The island is covered
over and over with luxuriant creeping beans, and is half an hour
long. Some of the vessels try their luck on the other side of the
island. A number of goats and sheep are pasturing there, and among
the latter, rams with horns twisted back, and manes. We keep the
main direction of the river, N.N.E., but there is neither direction
nor order among the vessels, “Allah kerim!”</p>

<p>A beautiful verdant island below seems to wish to block up our
road. Suddenly a second island appears at our side, separated from
the former one by only fifty paces of water. We stop at it, because
most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98_v2">[98]</span> of the
vessels have taken the deceptive broad path, and got upon the sand.
The current is strong here, and amounts to two miles. Although our
men are at home on the Nile, yet they have no idea at all that
where there are precipitous broken shores, and where the shoot of
the water falls, there, on the average, the greater depth is to be
found.</p>

<p>Suliman Kashef’s beautiful slave has hitherto not yet come out
of her narrow back cabin, often as I have begged him to let her. O
thou land of the East and jealousy! An unexpected emancipation of
the eastern wives and maidens would give an extremely surprising
result, judging from analogy with all the circumstances occurring
in the hárims, notwithstanding the trifling grade of cultivation,
in which these beautiful domestic animals stand, and their quaint
notions of the <em>honestum atque decorum</em>.</p>

<p>Four o’clock.—The last island, where we stopped only a short
time, and repaired in some measure our broken helm, is immediately
followed by two islands, lying close to one another, the nearest of
which extends a long way. It is covered with much larger tobacco
plantations than we have been accustomed hitherto to see. A hedge
defends it against the beasts of the water, and over the young
plants reed-roofs have been placed to protect them against the heat
of the sun. But what we had not hitherto seen, is a little
watchhouse raised on stakes, from which the field-guard peeps
out;—a police establishment, which might be placed here more on
account of human beings than of beasts.</p>

<p>We leave those islands, as well as the two small reed-islands
previously named, together with the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_99_v2">[99]</span> broad water at the left, for another
island of an hour in length joins on to the latter one, and
promises a deeper water-course. The steeply broken shores of these
islands, like those of the right side of the river, are stratified
in horizontal layers, which consist of mould, sand, and a
reddish-coloured substratum of iron-ochre. We go here with the
right shore to E. A broad gohr comes into the river from the right
side: therefore, what I just now called a right shore, is taken for
a large island, the head of which, however, no one pretends to have
seen. At last, we again advance, although not for any length of
time, in a bed of the stream destitute of islands, and from pure
magnanimity we order the oars to rest, so as not to stave in the
ribs of another vessel. On the right, a village and some scattered
tokuls under the trees. We make a bend to N.N.E. The right shore is
thickly covered with trees, but there appears to be little shade
there except under the solitary trees having broad boughs. On the
left shore are seen, on the contrary, few trees, and the real
forest may be further up the country.</p>

<p>Six villages are observed from the deck on the right, and three
villages on the left shore. Before us, to N.E., rises a small
mountain, to which we perhaps shall approach still closer, for it
was not remarked previously in our ascent. On the shore, we have
right and left a village; at the left side two more villages
immediately follow. From the deck we see here seven other villages;
to the right, in the forest, a large village, and closer to us a
small one on the shore, whilst on the left again, other tokul-tops
peep forth beyond the shore. Solitary huts are<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_100_v2">[100]</span> scattered on all sides, and the
country seems to be extraordinarily populous. Nevertheless, we
remark very few people; the others may be employed somewhere in the
interior harvesting, catching fish, or elephant-hunting; or state
affairs, perhaps, keep them back.</p>

<p>Five o’clock.—To N. On the left a little hamlet, with
tokul-roofs, which stand on short stakes, and may be used perhaps
only for the cattle during the rainy season. The small tokuls
raised on stakes serve partly as sleeping-places, partly as
store-houses; these are seen in every village on the White River.
Half-past five o’clock. At the left we see the end of an island,
which must be very large, for it goes up, at least, to the
last-named island, and may run behind it to the left shore. On the
left there are three villages, but the trees have entirely
disappeared. On the right five villages, and then a large and small
island; behind them a sixth village. The river makes a beautiful
bend at this place from N.N.E. to N. Splendid large shady trees
stand out like giants over the other part of the forest, and from
deck we perceive a hamlet under them, and also two villages at some
distance from the left shore. The Haba, properly speaking, displays
itself here of a blue colour in the distance, extending from W. to
N., whither we let ourselves be drifted also by the tranquil
river.</p>

<p>A large herd of cows comes down to drink at the stream, but we
pass proudly by, and the Arabian children do not murmur because
they are going to their dear home.</p>

<p>The report that the nations below had blocked up<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_101_v2">[101]</span> the river to cut off our
retreat, having turned out unfounded, may likewise have contributed
to this unusual contentment. I remarked evidently how glad they
were that no crowds of natives were collected at the numerous
villages, near which we were so often beneaped. On the right, the
end of an island displays itself; this, at all events, therefore
extends behind the upper island of the right shore. Over two little
islands we see, on the right side, the tops of several tokuls. At
sunset we go from N.N.W., in another bend to E. A long water-line
spreads before us, whilst the river bends to right and left; we
accommodate ourselves again slowly to rowing.</p>

<p>Half-past six o’clock. At both sides two long islands end, their
commencement having been concealed from us by others. Near the
pastoral village, on the left side, we hear the cattle and sheep
returning home, and see the smoke widely extended, as a protection
against the gnats, for their nightly rest. That is much too
inviting! Near a small green island, in the centre of the stream,
which spreads here majestically like a lake, we cast anchor, and
the vessel turns its bow towards the west, to Mount Nerkanjin, the
outlines of which stand out only faintly from the darkening sky. It
is a lovely evening.</p>

<p><span class="sc">31st January</span>.—Before sunrise we set out,
and had 20° Reaumur; yesterday and the day before, 19°. We had
scarcely advanced three paces, when we stuck fast on the sand,
because the crew wanted to let themselves be drifted at their ease.
We therefore row out of the lake-like bay to N.N.E. Men and women
stand smoking on the shore, and offer their pipes and other
effects, but all their signs and calling are in vain, and the fear
is general that the river may be too shallow. The stream issues
broadly from the left side behind an island, to which a smaller one
joins itself. Eight hippopotami are enjoying themselves in the
space between the two islands. Their enormous heads have the
closest similarity, at some distance, to those of buffaloes, only
they are larger, and have no horns, and therefore the Arabic
expression Gamùss el Bah’r (river buffalo) appears more
suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103_v2">[103]</span> than
that of hippopotamus. The name of G’zint is little used here,
although it may be the ancient indigenous one.</p>

<p>Whilst we are going at half-past six o’clock, N.N.W., we observe
on the right, also, a Nile arm to N.E. On the left a summer
village, and sleeping places, with reed walls, and small tokuls,
running quite to a point, and funnel-shaped, with plastered walls.
On the right, two hamlets, and on the left a reed islet; before it
a broad arm enters the land to W., and seems to form a large
island, for we go here N. by E. The stream, which had narrowed
previously to four hundred paces, loses little of its breadth by
these means. Before us floats again a green little reed-island; we
leave it at our right. The forest has again retreated, and on the
left, also, there is nothing seen above the ground, except here and
there the top of a tree. The shores are arid, and very refreshing
is the large tree on the right, with its horizontally twisted
boughs, like an isolated gigantic oak, behind which the house-tops
of a large village peep forth.</p>

<p>A number of ash-grey men set themselves to race us on the right
shore from a little village; they fife, sing, and clap their hands,
dance and jump, especially the young ones. On the left also the
flat sand-shore is covered with ash-grey people. The song on both
shores is kept up in the very same tune and time, which they
alternate by strophes. There are hardly any weapons and ornaments
to be seen on these men. Cleanliness, the red colour of the skin,
and luxury, seem to disappear with the neighbourhood of the
Sultan’s palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104_v2">[104]</span>Half-past
seven o’clock. N.N.W. We have a beautiful river-path before us,
winding towards N. Eight o’clock. An island at the left shore, the
land arm of which is mostly dry. We circumnavigate this with the
river, N.E. to N.N.W. When we came near to the natives, we found
that they had tried the water a little; now, therefore, they dance
and jump in long shining black boots and breeches, and grey close
jerkins. Such was their appearance, and one really could not help
laughing. Tokul-tops and a hamlet on the right shore; on the left a
small island.</p>

<p>Half-past eight o’clock. At the left side the beginning and end
of two islands, with a beautiful margin of reeds, and blooming
creepers. We go N.W.; a broad arm of the Nile in the right shore to
N. by E.; a large lake far towards the trees to S.E., and another
one equally large and distant, to the right of the Nile-arm to E.
The lakes are only visible from the masts. Behind an island on the
left, a cattle village, with numerous herds.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock. From N. to N.W. A large crowd of women are
singing, clapping their hands, jumping and shouting a bacchanalian
huzza, as if they would make our acquaintance with might and main.
A splendid shady group of trees, and a large tokul village, wherein
they now may play the master, is in their vicinity. We land at the
foot of the last-named island. I repair to Selim Capitan, to gather
information through the Tershomàn.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock. N. by E. On the left a broad gohr swerves to W.,
and is said to issue again among the Elliàbs. I remarked on the
shore a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105_v2">[105]</span>
willow I had never yet seen, which is altogether similar to our
Rhine willows. The reïs hugged the shore, to please me, but even
the last copse slipped through my fingers, without my being able to
cut off a branch. The forest of the right shore promises not only
variety from a distance, but also cooling shade.</p>

<p>Half-past ten o’clock. The river flows N.E.; on the right is a
large village, near which we wind N.W.; then soon N.N.W.</p>

<p>On the right, herds and huzzaing, and singing negroes. The
south-east wind freshens a little, just as we go N.W.; but we dare
not sail, on account of the numerous shallows: and for that reason
also, the mainmasts of all the larger vessels were taken down at
the commencement of our return voyage. In calm weather the sails
were spread over these masts, laid horizontally to protect the crew
from the sun. Selim Capitan knows what the men are able to endure,
and therefore commands repeatedly “Alma!” (rest); connecting it,
perhaps, with calm; whereupon the rowers discontinue their labour.
“Alma” means, besides, in the Aggem language in Taka, “water;” as
also among the Bishari and Shukuriës. We go N.E., and then N., and
round a green reed-island to S.W., but soon again to N. On the left
shore, a part of the new Haba suddenly discloses itself; we go a
short tract E.N.E., and at half-past eleven o’clock to N. The head
and foot of two islands, one close behind the other, are at the
right side. I see again the first <em>Zigzag</em> and
<em>Sammi</em>, two species of strand-snipes. The latter are called
by the Franks Dominicans; in Mahass and Dongola, Begha and Kegla.
They make the sportsman very angry, because they<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_106_v2">[106]</span> announce danger to the
other feathered tribe by their loud outcry.</p>

<p>Twelve o’clock. N.E. by E. On the left an island, and soon
afterwards, when we are navigating N.N.E., another on the right;
and some tokuls, with dancing women, on the shore of the downs. We
stick fast on the dry ground for a quarter of an hour, and have, at
half-past twelve o’clock, two islands on the left, close to one
another, with the usual green border of reeds. This side rises like
a hill, in the manner of downs, even to between the trees. We only
see the end of these islands. Water fixes here animal life, and
human population may spread far away from the main stream,
generally on the White River, which may be considered as shoreless.
We go round a sand-head of the right shore from N.E. to E., and at
a quarter before one o’clock to S. On the right an island, and on
the shore a village; on the left several people. With a short bend
we have come to the N.; go, at half-past one o’clock, to E., and
immediately left to N.E. At two o’clock E., and at half-past two N.
A sand-bank here protrudes itself half into the river from the left
shore. A summer village, with a large tree, stands behind.</p>

<p>On the sand-bank some pretty young girls had collected, and a
number of poor Ethiopians, highly delighted at our arrival. They
sing, throw themselves on their knees, spring up again in the air,
and stretch their hands imploringly towards us. Selim Capitan is
easily persuaded to stop a short time, and to distribute some of
the usual glass beads. The unaproned damsels, who could entreat in
so friendly a manner, and point to their neck and wrists, ran,
however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107_v2">[107]</span> away
immediately, when we wanted to give into their own hands some
strings with glass beads. There appears to me to be no doubt that
there is a certain separation of the sexes; for these girls, part
of whom were marriageable, kept aloof at some distance from the
men: this also, shortly before, was the case with the married
women. The latter appeared here and there together with the men;
but there were always very few of them, and it might therefore be
considered the exception to the general rule. Opposite to the
sand-bank an arm of the Nile enters E.N.E. far into the land of the
right side of the river. We row to N., but soon to E., N.E., and
N.</p>

<p>Three o’clock. We leave, about N.W., the broader river separated
from us by two islands lying close to one another, and have on the
right the large island, or island-land, near which the arm of the
Nile enters in an easterly direction. We follow this arm N.E. and
N., and the island, at its entrance, has immediately an end here. A
summer pastoral village is at the right on the shore of this large
so-called gohr. A quarter after three o’clock. Again from N.E. to
N. Several women stand on the right shore near a simsim-field; they
wear behind them a large piece of leather, like a miner’s apron,
which may serve them, when they sit down, as a cushion. The rahàt
in front of them is not larger than a hand. Their shrill cry of
exultation sounds almost the same as that of the women of Khartùm
and Kàhira. At half past three o’clock, on the right two
farm-yards, surrounded regularly in the square with palisadoes;
beautiful verdant young trees are standing by them. The forest
seems to have vanished on all sides. From<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_108_v2">[108]</span> N. we come gradually to N.E., and go now
N.W., where the river makes a splendid bend to the N. A village
lies a little up the country on the right side, and an island ends
by it.</p>

<p>Everywhere we notice watchhouses among the produce of the fields
or tobacco-plants. They consist of four stakes, with a scaffold,
and over it a flat straw roof clogged with earth, such as is seen
also in the land of Sudàn. If these little watchhouses are not
erected against thieves or beasts,—the former I believe to be the
case on account of the abominable suspicion of the people in
barter,—they may be a shelter for the labourers when carrying on
the irrigation. The black gentlemen had bent reeds, which had grown
crooked, for their tobacco-pipes. In order to express their joy,
they jump like goats, with closed legs, swinging at the same time
their arms. When old men singly try these leaps, as I saw done
previously by a sheikh of the Ababdes, when we called him an old
man (aguhs), it looks extremely ridiculous; but it is abominable
and disgusting when old women, with their flabby breasts flying up
and down, make such jumps of joy. A very narrow canal leads either
to a lake or low ground, or it may form a tributary arm and an
island at the right.</p>

<p>The water here is still as clear and well-tasted as above near
the mountains: sand has much to do with this. We do not remark,
either, any stagnant water, standing in connexion with the stream,
as further downwards. The thermometer has got up to 30°. Four
o’clock, E.N.E. Several singing negroes on the right shore.
Immediately N.N.E., a quarter of an hour later N. and N.W., but
soon in a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109_v2">[109]</span>
bend to N.N.E. The river is about two hundred paces broad. Half
past four o’clock. From N.N.E. to ——, we bring up first,—N.E. by E.
for a short tract; with a short bend after a quarter of an hour
N.W. A powerful Nile buffalo, looked upon with astonishment, even
by the sailors themselves, being a gigantic animal, plays before us
in the water, and induces the two engineers to leave for a moment
their cloister system; usually they have their windows hung with
curtains, and never let themselves be seen at all outside the door.
Five o’clock. From N.W. to N.E., where a beautiful water-road
extends before us, closed below by a green island. On the right a
broad Nile-arm comes from S.E., and discharges itself to S.; it
seems, therefore, to encircle a large and broad island. A number of
people have collected there. The river is quite calm, unmoved by a
breath of air; no oar is striking its polished surface: we sail
with unruffled temper, protected against the rays of the sun, under
the covering of the denda (ship’s tent, perhaps from the Italian
<em>tenda</em>). A surprising swarm of black-coloured people
accompanies us along the shore. We see how they wonder at our
vessels, without comprehending how such a mighty machine could have
originated from a sürtuk, or hewn-out trunk of a tree. The
invention of their ancestors has remained here in its natural first
foundation, for their necessities give no impulse to the
improvement of these boats, which may have been even in use, in
this part of Africa, before they were on the Rhine, the Danube, and
the Thames.</p>

<p>The nation of the Liènns is already in possession of this
country. The Liènns have the same language as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_110_v2">[110]</span> the inhabitants of Bari; but they
know also that of the Dinka nation, or the dialect of the Dinkas,
which alters down the river, if such deviations have not been
carried down with the features of the people. They stand in
friendly relations with Bari, and do not pay tribute to King
Làkono, as I heard plainly from Selim Capitan’s interpreter.
Notwithstanding that their forehead is covered with points in
horizontal lines, they seem to be of the same origin as the tribes
of Bari. The Tershomàn Gùmberi, who gave himself out previously for
a Tshièrr, pretends here suddenly to be a Liènn, and wants to go
ashore with his treasures. He had accompanied us through the
country of Bari, and appeared also to be known there. It seems to
me that he has commercial speculations in his head, and fears that
we might take from him again his beads. We induce him, however, to
remain still with us, because he is very clever in his way. Half
past five o’clock. On the right a village, with good tokuls, and
the green island long seen by us. A city called Djàr follows soon
after. Another island ends before the village, separated from it by
a narrow gohr. A third village lies further down the river; to the
left shore an island with a green head, near which we stop at
sunset, for we see on the shore a large herd of cattle.</p>

<p><em>1st February.</em>—It was with difficulty that I purchased a
national bracelet of ivory, for these ornaments are as if grown to
the people. Such bracelets are light, two to three fingers broad,
and fluted, these stripes being coloured black. Small
tortoise-shells are worn very commonly here, as in Bari, on the
neck or arm. At eight o’clock we leave the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_111_v2">[111]</span> island, go N. by E., and see upon it
several scattered farm-yards with cultivation.</p>

<p>An island of three-quarters of an hour long was at our right.
The east wind is tolerably brisk: we soon take to our oars, and I
imagine we make in this manner three sea-miles in the hour. This
pace stands as the rule with Selim Capitan, when the wind is not
contrary. Before us we perceive a forest, which extends over the
horizon on the left shore. The latter is planted far and wide with
lubien, or small white and variegated beans; so is also the small
island of a quarter of an hour in length, lying at our right. Nine
o’clock. From E. by N., to N.E., and N. by E. On the left side of
the river, where we remark a village up the country, an arm of the
Nile goes N.N.W., and forms a reed-island.</p>

<p>Owing to the laziness of the sailors, the east wind drives us
into this canal on the sand, from which we get off again at
half-past nine o’clock; a small island, with a border of green
creeping flowers, is at our right. A large village is seen on the
left, with large and small well-covered tokuls. On the large ones
the roof reaches nearly to the ground, and rests upon stakes;
behind this circular portico, we see the plastered walls of the
habitation properly speaking. The small tokuls have higher walls,
but not this lengthening of the roof, supported on stakes, and
which we saw also in Bari. Behind the small flower island, a city
or large village rises on the right shore.</p>

<p>We go N. by E., and remark on the left side two other large
villages quite in the neighbourhood of the preceding one. The
forest of the right shore has again approached; a small green
vegetable island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112_v2">[112]</span>
being separated from it by a narrow arm; some hundreds of paces
further another small island, which, besides scanty reeds, is
thickly covered at the upper end with vegetables of various kinds,
whilst species of couch-grass and creeping water-plants are
floating round by the shores. Beyond it we see three villages lying
on the margin of the river, really romantically, before and between
the trees. On the left shore two neat farmyards shew themselves in
a shining seriba of reeds, the stalks of which are connected very
regularly with each other, but perhaps only afford resistance to
tame animals. All these villages were surrounded, however, with a
stronger enclosure of thorn-like shrubs, as a defence against wild
beasts and naked men. A large thorn-bush supplies the place of a
door, and cannot well be seized and pulled out from the outside, as
it is drawn and squeezed into the door posts with its lower end.
Such a seriba is common in the whole land of Sudàn; the
before-mentioned reed-walls are likewise very general, and attract
immediately the curious eye. The tokuls have, in part, a roof
protruding in the middle with a wavy form, like also some
previously seen, but the latter had low walls. A number of negroes
have collected, without weapons or ornaments, and shining black,
for they have passed through water.</p>

<p>Half-past 10 o’clock, N.N.W. In the middle of the river an
island a quarter of an hour in length, covered with lubiën. A city
with tokuls packed close together on the right shore, a village
being opposite. Another large village is united to the city, which
reaches over the island; its tokuls are mostly<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_113_v2">[113]</span> surrounded with reed-walls, and
probably the women are shut up in them. A beautiful tree with
wide-spreading branches rises between these two cities, and may
serve them for their place of meeting.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock, N. We leave to our left an island of an hour in
length, elevated only three feet above water-mark, covered at its
head with reeds, vegetables, durra, and lubiën. The shores are
planted right and left. We stuck nearly fast by the large city; and
now we have the <em>trinchetta</em> or foresail as leader, so that
we may navigate on the sand more splendidly. The forest emerges on
the left shore, and solitary beautiful trees stand on the margin of
the river, between which an island grown over with reeds, of a
quarter of an hour in length, is situated. In the space of ten
minutes another one follows. The vessels halt at the shore to wait
for Selim Capitan and the other vessels navigating on the sand. We
lie to at the left shore, and the order to wash the vessels is also
complied with by us.</p>

<p>Fadl and Sale had already gone from the ship on a hunting
excursion, though I had no idea that they would do so while the
vessels were advancing. I looked about anxiously from the deck,
when a sailor shouted to me from the mast that he saw them at a
distance. It was not long before I heard them shooting, and they
came to the right shore with a large elephant’s tooth on their
shoulders. I had them fetched off in the sandal, and then found the
length of this tooth to be eight feet and a half. It was
unfortunately a little decayed, but yet one of the largest we had
on the vessels, for the larger ones were generally from seven to
seven feet and a half long. It had served also<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_114_v2">[114]</span> as a stake to tie oxen to, and was
purchased for a few large glass beads.</p>

<p>We set out at half-past two o’clock, but the east wind drives us
back to the left shore. The land here is principally cultivated
with simsim and lubëin. Watchhouses, scarecrows, old baskets, and
skins stuck upon poles, are paraded about in the fields. Everything
is standing green and beautiful. It is impossible that the natives
can water these large fields by hand, as I saw by the small tobacco
plantations. In vain, however, I looked about for regular
irrigation canals, by which they conducted the water from the river
to gush over the land, in the manner usual in Egypt and Nubia, from
the simplest contrivances up to the chain of buckets drawn by oxen;
for water-wheels or saghiën cease with the Arab tribes on the White
Stream. The clayey fruitful soil must therefore be able to retain,
for a long time, the moisture remaining after the inundation, and
the strong nocturnal deposits may preserve the fruits fresh; the
more so, because the sun, owing to the abundance of thick plants,
cannot scorch the ground.</p>

<p>The creeping beans seem to have the power especially of
attracting to themselves atmospheric moisture; I saw them often, on
quite arid soil, where everything else was already dried up,
spreading from one root up to twenty paces distant in the most
luxuriant dark green foliage. It was only with caution that one
dare raise these long tendrils, to seek the slender long pods, for
animals liking moisture—such as snakes and loathsome reptiles—take
up their abode under them. Soon we push off again from the shore
and go to N.N.E. On the left an island, which is
cultivated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115_v2">[115]</span>
towards its lower end, whilst the reeds are wisely allowed to stand
at the upper end, on account of the pressure of water. Near the
pastoral village in the neighbourhood a large tree rises. Our men
believe that veneration is paid to trees standing isolated. Another
small island, covered with grass and reeds, obeys still the element
from which it rose.</p>

<p>The shores of the river are generally green, and enjoy the
cultivation of the human hand. The land extends flat on the right,
encircled by the Habas: four villages lie in it, and the village on
the shore is really large. On the left, a small and pretty
river-meadow with a tokul and watchhouses; we make a strong bend to
N.N.W., and here ends on the left the former island, above half an
hour in length. A fifth village joins the four others; the solitary
farm-houses are surrounded with hedges of light reeds, as also the
farm-yards, wherein a few tokuls lie together. The latter, perhaps,
as generally in the land of Sudàn, harbour an increasing family,
and increase with it till they become a large settlement, where the
head of the family has the precedence according to the rights of
primogeniture; this we find also in King Làkono’s dominions. Though
harvest has taken place on the right shore, we see on the left
nothing but green cultivation.</p>

<p>Three o’clock. We land below this Ethiopian pentapolis on the
right shore. Here, therefore, the bairàm-el-kebir will be probably
solemnised. Unfortunately I do not see a tree under the shade of
which I could seat myself, but interesting purchases of the
national curiosities may be made. My speculation<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_116_v2">[116]</span> in elephants’-teeth is
considerable, and a kind of mercantile rage comes over me for the
first time in my life, when I think how I shall surprise my dear
brother in Khartùm, as we are drinking the first glass of wine
together in the divàn, and my three faithful Baràbras, covered with
the weapons and ornaments of the people of these countries, march
in through the bye-door and lay the whole booty at our feet. We are
here in the country of Bamber, and the large village city bears the
name of Berize. Here Gùmberi, our interpreter, is really at home: I
see how his relations shake hands with him and press him in their
arms. His countrymen have generally, but not always, these single
tattooed prominences or points upon the forehead, which reach in
six or eight lines crossways to the temples. The natives are, on
the average, of considerable height, although we find among them
men of moderate size, but they are destitute of the muscular
structure of limbs of the highlanders, and are much more slimly
built: the formation of the face and the language is, however,
similar to those above. They are dirty, and may be called
<em>poor</em>, in respect to their ornaments and weapons, compared
with the people of the highlands of Bari. The ivory bracelets we
find dearer here than anywhere else; the interpreter, who has left
on board the greatest part of his beads for temporary safe-keeping,
may have enlightened them on the value of our ornaments, in order
to remain the safer in possession of his own treasures.</p>

<p>They produce their iron weapons from Bari, and seem not to wish
to sell them at all. This deserves all praise, and shews that they
reflect; for being a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117_v2">[117]</span> small nation they ought always to be
ready for combat. The forest behind the wide-extended durra-stubble
consists of melancholy geïlid trees on dry and sandy soil. The men
bring wood, every one a little log: a couple of small beads are
given to each. They are contented, like children; but they manage
to steal our purchased wood and sell it to us a second time. My
servants tell me that they have found a deep pit covered at the top
lightly with straw, in which elephants are caught. A barking dog
was fastened to a corner of it. The latter is a huntsman’s whistle
to entice the elephants who may chance to be curious. This manner
of catching elephants is common throughout all the land of Sudàn,
especially in Fàzogl. We were not a little afraid formerly in Taka
of falling, during our nocturnal marches, with our horses, into
these elephant-pits, as frequently happens in the Chasuas. In truth
the people in Taka seem to stand on friendly terms with elephants,
and to leave the hunting of them to the mountain people of that
country, although Sauachinn (Sauakim) on the Red Sea is the staple
town of ivory, from whence it goes to India, and afterwards to
Europe.</p>

<p><em>2nd of February.</em>—To-day is the great Bairam feast. The
rising sun is greeted with twenty-one cannon-shots: all the people
run away, and do not return till after all the guns had been
discharged. I learned from Feïzulla Capitan the formula of the
usual congratulation: “Bairam Sheriff ma berèk,” and set off with
it to the two commanders. The Egyptians could not belie, on this
opportunity, their innate Bakshish mania, and came one after the
other for drink-money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118_v2">[118]</span>Arnaud is so
ill that he cannot leave his vessel, and raves incessantly. With
the exception of some small elephants’ teeth, I only acquire,
notwithstanding Fadl’s activity, a few ivory bracelets and iron
buckles, with an oblong plate. Although Selim Capitan yesterday, at
the request of Gùmberi, who petitioned for his countrymen,
distributed some cups, with the usual sug-sug, among the people,
and also presented strings of beads to certain individuals, yet
they only brought us to-day, at last, <em>one</em> ox. Gùmberi
seemed not to possess the proper influence with his friends, and,
moreover, to have excited the envy of a chief; for he had only
fetched away, at night, from Selim Capitan, his glass treasures,
under the promise of several paschal lambs. We set out at half-past
eleven o’clock at noon from Berize, and leave on the right a
reed-island, of the length of half an hour, the lower part of which
is covered with lubiën. N.W. by W. Both shores are cultivated. At
one o’clock a large village on the right; opposite, another one,
with open tokuls, and a strong palisado-kind of enclosure,
seemingly as a protection against wild beasts, if not against men
themselves; for this is a station of herds. N.E. by N., and a
quarter after one o’clock to N. Near the large village three others
are in a line, on the right side of the river, the last numbering
about a hundred and fifty tokuls. The walls of the magazines, being
raised on stakes, are wattled like baskets, and then besmeared with
clay; the tokuls for the cattle, which also stand separately here,
are protected by a strong seriba of trunks of trees and thorns;
whilst around the habitations of human beings there are hedges of
reeds, partly smooth. Opposite,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_119_v2">[119]</span> at a little distance from the left
shore, another village. To judge from the shores, beans here appear
to afford a principal means of nourishment. Half-past one o’clock.
From N.N.E. to W. by N., and then N.N.W. Solitary tokuls, near
which the beans occupy entire plains. From N.N.W. immediately again
W. Some hundreds of royal cranes perched here quite gorgeously on a
sand-bank; they were right not to keep their position, for I had
raised the “longue carabine,” as my brother used to call our long
Turkish gun. A quarter before two o’clock, N.W. From the deck we
see four villages to the right, and one to the left.</p>

<p>Before us we have the obtuse corner of an island, which has from
here considerable extension. Large herds of cows and villages are
scattered upon it. Away over the end of this island we see, on the
right side of the river, three more villages. In consequence of the
shallows, we leave the right arm of the Nile and make for the left
shore before the broad island, going again aback. Close to the
nearest village, on the large island, a number of blacks have
collected.</p>

<p>The leader of the chorus leads the choir, and the multitude
answers with fearful vigour. A troop of <em>élites</em>, assembled
before the crowd, run in close column backwards and forwards,—their
leader at their head, commanding them, and holding a pole, on the
top of which an animal’s tail was fastened, clearly in order to
give us a warlike representation. But they bring several heads of
cattle to the shore. These are reasonable men: we have, in truth,
no meat, and the sailors crack the rough lubiën-pods and the
durra-stalks like sugar-canes. Real garden warblers<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_120_v2">[120]</span> are these Arabs, and all
the blacks. Selim Capitan has already reached the island, whilst we
remain fixed on the sand until I wake up the captain. I hear the
sailors gasping forth “eh lissa,” but I know this simulating of
extreme exertion, when each man trusts to the other one working. At
half-past two o’clock we pushed on through the left arm of the Nile
over to the island, where there was a great huzzaing and joy on the
vessels touching land. Again they brought three oxen, and a
splendid barter took place. Besides fowls, goats, and sheep, they
bring a quantity of elephants’ teeth, panthers’, leopards’ and
monkeys’ skins, little stools, iron buckles, ivory bracelets,
weapons, lubiën, small water-melons, woollen war-caps, iron
necklaces, strings twisted together of little shining black fruits,
fixed like beads, &amp;c. The people are very friendly, and willing
to oblige, and I might say, more cultivated than those of Bari. We
are on the large island called after the name of the neighbouring
great village Buko. The latter contains more than five hundred
tokuls. I hear, to my astonishment, that the nation here is not
called Bamber, but Buko, and that the tribe of the Bambers has its
boundaries before this island, and is only a small race, like the
Korreji, or Korreschi, who are said to dwell above the Bambers, and
may have originated from Mount Korreji in Barì. It seems that these
Bukos are of one race with the Bambers, Tshièrrs, and Liènns, for
they have generally their foreheads dotted. The formation of the
face, and other physical qualities—the large and moderate stature,
also speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121_v2">[121]</span> in
favour of a common origin and subsequent separation.</p>

<p>The arm of the Nile wherein we lie, and which we shall navigate,
is called Kirboli; the right and narrow arm on the other side of
the island, towards N., Kirti. Selim Capitan requests me to
accompany him to the Kirti. We went down it in the sandal for the
distance of half an hour, and found its breadth to be seventy-five
metres, by the assistance of the rope which was drawn across it
through one of the plundered sürtuks. As far as we can see, this
arm goes, with slight declinations to E. and W., entirely to N.,
which direction the natives also gave. According to this it would
be our nearest road, but its water is unknown, and it is not
thought safe to let the lighter vessels take this short cut.</p>

<p>With respect to this little track, it had a depth, at the
commencement, of two, immediately afterwards of two and a half,
and, at the end of our excursion, of three and a quarter fathoms.
We returned about evening by land,—painful enough for Sabatier and
myself, who are just convalescent,—and passed by nine small
villages, or groups of tokuls, which I had taken, at our anchorage,
for three villages, and then had counted thirteen. The surface of
the earth is an excellent humus on this side, and the little fields
were trenched with furrows for irrigation, and on which, among
other things, we found water-melons. On the extensive plain of the
island we do not observe a tree, except some small ones, near our
vessels, and a large one behind the city of Buko. From a distance
we saw the natives harpooning fish, which they brought<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_122_v2">[122]</span> soon for sale to us. But
here, also, we found, in general, an intolerable and abominable
mistrust.</p>

<p><em>3rd February.</em>—The natives have generally few ornaments,
weapons, and other effects; and little, therefore, could I acquire
in this respect. Yet I did a good business in ivory, and I please
myself at the idea of how you, my dear brother, will stare, though
far,—far are we yet asunder.</p>

<p>An old man, having two thick ivory rings, of a hand’s breadth,
on the upper part of each arm, and leathern strings round his neck,
will have nothing to do with selling or the new glass trade. He
regards the glass beads with a certain air of contempt,—won’t have
them, even gratis, and looks disdainfully at the childish passion
of his nation. I see him now from the vessel, quietly sitting under
a little tree, and smoking his pipe, without troubling himself to
come nearer to us. He smoked, as is frequently seen on the White
Stream, <em>charcoal</em>, from want of tobacco—called here also
tabak—a thing which none of us could imitate. When I gave him
tobacco, he became at once quite friendly, knocked the charcoal out
of his pipe, filled it, took down the little tongs, to which there
was a shovel attached, from the pipe-tube, and laid a coal upon
it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what we had been already told in Bari about the
traffic in slaves, was confirmed here. Las Casas,<a id=
"FNanchor_6v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_6v2" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
who effected the freedom of the Indians,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_123_v2">[123]</span> transplanted therefore an abuse only
from one quarter of the globe to the other, without considering its
results. In the mutual wars here, the prisoners, like those of the
Greeks, Romans, and ancient Germans, are made slaves. Yet, perhaps,
among these people they are redeemed by paying a certain number of
cattle. Men-hunts, properly speaking, do not seem to take place,
and their wars consist only in the reciprocal plunder of herds, and
the revenge thereby occasioned, when they may seize on human beings
as an equivalent for their pillaged property.</p>

<p>Cattle are here of considerable value, and this may arise from
the great population, which therefore does not despise meat. A
slave costs <em>an ox</em>, or <em>six iron bracelets</em>, which
are not thicker than a little finger. It is Sultan Làkono who takes
their slaves from them, giving iron in return; and as in the land
of Sudàn, golden okiën serve instead of coined money, so here rings
are used for the same purpose. It may be also a kind of policy in
this king paying only in rings, and not in weapons, by the
possession of which his neighbours might become dangerous to him.
Làkono comes to this place every year, with several large sürtuks,
and winds up this business in person. He requires these slaves for
labour (those seen by us seemed quite contented with their lot)—to
get the iron and work it, and also perhaps for his protection. The
despots of Sennaar also keep up their dignity by slaves, and not by
a body-guard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124_v2">[124]</span>
women, any more than Sultan Làkono. The Turks profited by this
cheap opportunity to buy slaves, and Suliman Kashef, who on the
former expedition brought fifteen slaves to Khartùm, and sold them
as soldiers, is said to have taken this morning several on board
his vessel. I am unable alone to oppose this want of discipline.
Even M. Arnaud, who pretended previously to oppose with me any
purchase of slaves, has been found very willing to take on board a
young native girl, who, however, is said to belong to the
woman-hating Selim Capitan, as a plaything for his little slave, or
for himself, which makes the invalid Sabatier perfectly
furious.</p>

<p>Half-past eleven o’clock. We leave the island, and go at first
S.W. by S., and then proceed N.N.W. on the Kirboli (Bah’r el
abiat). On the right we have immediately the large village of Buko,
which turns longitudinally from the shore. The tree standing there
is taken not only by me, but also by the Egyptians, for a
<em>sycamore</em>. Three villages follow on the shore of the
island; the last also is not a small one. For a moment we are
beneaped, and get ourselves in motion by rowing against the
north-east wind, which is looming. The latter village becomes still
larger, and is connected with several others; from which, at twelve
o’clock, a small hamlet is separated by an interval of space. The
pointed roofs, which are frequently so shelving, of the little
tokuls, and which I at first could not explain, are nothing but the
movable coverings of the wattled magazines. We wind S.W. by W. On
the right a large and small village, W.N.W. and N. The arm of the
Nile here is not more than a hundred and fifty paces<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_125_v2">[125]</span> broad. Half-past twelve
o’clock N.W. and W. by E. Three villages on the right, and on the
left, from the deck, a distant Haba. Not far from the shore,
another village on the island. One o’clock.—We go to E.N.E., and
wind to the left W. by N. The island continues cultivated, and we
perceive again a hamlet upon it. Half-past one o’clock.—From W. by
N., to N.E. by N., and a short tract N.N.W. We halt at this place
to wait for Selim Capitan. After a quarter of an hour we set out
again, and go from W.N.W. to N.N.E.</p>

<p>Several purchases were made, and there is eternal strife,
robbery, and theft of beads, among the crew. I see there will be
murder and homicide; for every one now wants spears and ebony
clubs, as well as strings of ostrich-egg aglets. It is fortunate
that the ivory is claimed by the government, and private purchase
of it forbidden. We observe here also some of those gigantic
ant-hills, which are so common on the low ground down the river.
From the deck we remark two villages on the left side, before the
forest, which is half an hour distant.</p>

<p>Two o’clock. N., and immediately W. by N. A large village upon
the island is seen from the deck at a little distance from the
right shore. Half-past two o’clock. At the right a broad arm of the
Nile, going to N.W., and forming a small island. We leave it to the
right, and go W. by N. and N. to N.N.E.; then round a sand-head
again, S.W. by W. The shores are mostly precipitously broken off;
layers of humus, sand, and earth impregnated with iron oxyde, which
forms here also the substratum. A quarter before three o’clock.
Round a sand-bank of the right<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_126_v2">[126]</span> shore for five minutes, N.N.E., then
N.W. for an equally short time, and to N. by W. The shores here are
covered, for the most part, with green reeds.</p>

<p>Three o’clock. The thermometer rose this morning, up to noon,
from 20° to 27°, and has now, at three o’clock, 30°. Towards N.
From the deck, a village on the left, and two on the right. N.W. by
N. Three villages on the left, and one on the right; the former
near the Haba, which is a quarter of an hour distant. Half-past
three o’clock. From W.N.W. to N.N.E. Two villages on the left, a
little remote from the shore. A very short tract E.N.E., and we
round a long sand-head to W. Six hippopotami are enjoying
themselves before us, as yesterday; and it seems that they retreat,
when the stream falls, into the marsh regions, where they are more
secure from man.</p>

<p>To N. Here we again see hippopotami and crocodiles near one
another; they live peaceably together, as is generally known here,
and a crocodile would never attack a hippopotamus, much as he might
like perhaps his flesh. The latter has, indeed, like the elephant,
a clumsy appearance, but notwithstanding this, he displays an
incomparably greater activity in water and on land than the
crocodile; besides, he is as courageous as a bull, as soon as he is
provoked, and attacks men and tramples them under his feet, when he
is wounded on shore. On the other hand, he is said never to go
ashore from the water, when he is struck there by the harpoon, to
pursue and take revenge.</p>

<p>We remark four villages in the neighbourhood of the right shore,
or on the island of Buko. Nearly all<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_127_v2">[127]</span> these villages are to be seen only from
the deck over our cabin. Four o’clock. From N.W. to N.E. by N. The
hippopotami appear angry at their tranquillity being disturbed by
us foreign intruders. They move quite boldly near to the vessels,
snort and throw up water, although they have not been offended, as
they were previously, by shots, which are discontinued, owing to
the great mischief perpetrated by these beasts at that time. From
N.E. by N., immediately to N.W. Some trees come in view, and soon
also a solitary dhellèb-palm—a pleasing sight which we had long
been deprived of. For some hours we have seen no people on the
shore, although three villages are found here again at a short
distance from it. The purchase of slaves or kidnapping cannot be
unknown to them, and they may fear a <em>quid pro quo</em> for
themselves, and not trust the seeming peace. Half-past four
o’clock. To W., a little way to S.W., and then W. by S., at which
bend the river is scarcely fifty paces broad. Reed-shores
throughout. From the very short tract W. by S. to S.W. by S. Here a
broad arm goes to N.W., and forms an island at our right, where
Suliman Kashef is already halting, whilst we are still clinging to
the left shore. Five o’clock. Before us, to S.S.W., the river again
separates, and forms another island. The right arm is our road, and
goes S.S.W.; the left goes S.S.E. The latter appears to have become
quite dry, for the negroes have drawn a barrier of reeds through
it, in order to shut out the fish found in this gohr. We land at
the first island. The arm lying to S.S.W. shews itself now as a
gohr, discharging itself with unusual rapidity into the Nile,
instead of forming our<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_128_v2">[128]</span> track, for our course runs with the
former great arm to N.W.</p>

<p><em>4th February,</em>—Yesterday was the last day of the great
Bairam. Selim Capitan and Suliman Kashef had called up all the
skill of Turkish cookery to give us Franks a good dinner, at which
we were the jollier because the Frenchmen had lost several bottles
of wine in a wager. The river, flowing in S.S.W., and said to be an
arm of the Nile, puzzles me exceedingly. According to the natives,
it comes from the mountains above, and indeed from the Nile itself.
If it come from above, it must make a considerable bend; for it
flows from the left side into the river, and follows upwards its
direction immediately from S.S.W. to W.: it must cut through,
somewhere, the old sanded and choked-up primitive bed of the Nile,
to come from E. or S.E. from the mountains to W. It might be
possible that the half dried-up gohr, from S.S.E., serves as its
main bed at high water, and this being sanded up, it had retreated
now into the deeper canal. Selim Capitan found the breadth of this
tributary, or gohr, to be eighty metres near the before-mentioned
solitary dhellèb-palm on its shore. The rapidity of its current is
greater than usual in the White river, and amounts to three
sea-miles and a half. Still it is doubtful whether it be a river
discharging itself, or a Nile arm. Clouds, threatening rain, have
shewn themselves for some days, and in the evening-whole coveys of
swallows are moving towards the N. We have seen no dhellèb-palms on
the shores of our Kirboli, although there are some of them on the
main stream. The Kirboli, therefore, may have already reached its
termination here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129_v2">[129]</span>I hear, from
Selim Capitan and his interpreter, who is well acquainted with this
country, that we passed by two tribes yesterday afternoon; and I
understand now what the natives wanted to tell me when we yesterday
halted for a moment to wait for Selim Capitan. According to what
the Bukos themselves said, they were as large a nation as their
island. But this is incorrect; for at two o’clock yesterday, this
tribe ceased, and was followed by that of the Tshièrrs, who possess
both shores from thence, and reach to the neighbourhood of this
place, where Bohrs appear on the right shore. The Tshièrrs have
their foreheads stippled, like the people dwelling upwards, and use
also the same language. Downwards from them the language is again
allied to that of the Dinkas. It was, therefore, the little country
of the Tshièrrs, where no one was seen on the shore, because they
feared that we were set against them by the Bukos. However, the
tribes above named, having similar tongues and descent, do not live
in open feud, for I met myself with men of the Tshièrrs at the top
of the island. A couple of them also were with Selim Capitan, and
told him that their countrymen had fled from us.</p>

<p>It was here where I was so ill on our ascent, and yet was
sufficiently sensible to request to be bled. Therefore, everything
now is new to me, and I am the more anxious for intelligence about
the stream territory of this place. As I hear from Thibaut and
Selim Capitan, Arnaud applied himself to the sextant on our ascent,
and found 3° 48′! Selim made himself merry at the engineer’s
expense, because he himself, on the first expedition, the limits of
which were some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130_v2">[130]</span>
hours further upwards, had likewise found, or pretended to have
found, 3° and some minutes. The difference, however, appears now by
the calculation at not less than 3°!</p>

<p>We are here among the Elliàbs, who are constantly at war with
the Bòhrs dwelling opposite. Twenty-four Bòhrs had come across to
us to-day and brought us cows. The Elliàbs wanted to fall at once
on these men, and to massacre them. We made earnest remonstrance to
them to prevent such a scene, but they continued angry at the Bòhrs
coming into their territory, and thought that they could provide us
as well with cattle. The Bòhrs seem to be wealthy, and are better
armed than the Elliàbs. They <em>hunt</em> elephants, but also
catch them in pits as elsewhere. The Elliàbs have their foreheads
adorned, like the Keks, with artificial wrinkles. They want also
the four lower incisors, as is generally the case on the White
Stream. The people are not muscularly limbed, but tolerably tall.
They wear a feather on the head, or a coiffure like a flat basket,
which may serve them as such, for it is only very loosely put
on.</p>

<p>The war-dance which they performed in honour of us was of the
same character as those we had hitherto seen, but it was executed
here even in detail. They approach us marching in a column, with a
leader at their head. The commander tunes the battle-song, and the
chorus answer him. They run forward, and the column breaks, because
in their wars they meet breast to breast; they parry with their
hands the feigned hostile darts, and avoid them, bending and
writhing their body, and kneeling down. They<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_131_v2">[131]</span> retreat, and the leader encourages
them by a warsong, and even a woman steps out from their little
company and sings to them to inspire them with courage, in quite a
different melody, and with half-threatening, half-imploring
gestures. The column has again closed, deploys a second time, and
sings its answer in vehement and broken notes. We need not
understand the language in such a warlike play, which reminds us
irresistibly of the ancient Germans. They generally performed this
dumb show with a pliability and truth of expression, such as no
European <em>artiste</em> could imitate, unless he had learned
their manner of carrying on war from his infancy. Moreover it does
not seem that they carry shields, because otherwise they would have
made the parry with their hand differently. When I think how
skilfully the dexterous horsemen of the Shaigiës performed the
well-known girid, or Dshirid game, threw the obtuse spears, parried
them with the hand or the girid, which answers to the German
<em>gerte</em> (switch), or avoided them, now I believe that the
men of Bari mostly make use in their wars of the little
hand-shields. The Elliàbs have brought cattle; but repeatedly
declare that it is the same to them whether Selim Capitan gives
them beads or not. Such proud disinterestedness has not hitherto
come before our notice.</p>

<p><em>5th February.</em>—The thermometer shewed, before sunrise,
15°; yesterday morning, however, 20°, but at noon it was not higher
than 27°, and at three o’clock 28°, and fell after sunset to 26°.
The hygrometer has been so disordered by Arnaud’s masterhand, that
he cannot even make use of it himself.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132_v2">[132]</span> This morning was misty, damp, and cold.
The corn was brought ashore from the vessels, and it was discovered
that a great part of it was mouldy. The bad condition of the
vessels is alone the cause of this, and Selim Capitan bears the
blame, because he had not taken care to have them properly caulked
before setting out. The people of this place have no ornaments on
themselves, and not even elephants’ teeth to dispose of. I could
only therefore procure a broad iron bracelet, and looked with a
kind of envy, when Selim Capitan despatched the sandal to the
Bòhrs, on the right shore, and fetched off a number of beautiful
elephants’ teeth. Cultivation is not to be seen on and near our
anchorage.</p>

<p>Selim Capitan asserts, that the questionable river is a gohr,
which he saw in the country of the Liènns, flowing away from the
main stream. I cannot persuade myself that I could have overlooked
this, with all my earnest attention. We shall navigate it therefore
this afternoon, in order to divest ourselves of uncertainty.</p>

<p><span class="sc">6th February</span>.—Yesterday the doubtful
river was indeed investigated, but only for a very short distance,
for the wind was contrary, and the sailors and soldiers murmured
loudly, because they knew that this intermediate voyage, which
threatened to delay their arrival in Khartùm, arose from the
Franks. Under such circumstances, even the expressions of the
natives of the country cannot be depended upon, for our black
soldiers can translate just what pleases them. At first the river
was said to come from the mountains above, and now they make it
take its origin as a gohr near the Liènns. We had an interpreter
with us, who is familiar with its shores, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_134_v2">[134]</span> who returned to us at this
opportunity. When he also confirmed the new assertion, the further
examination was provisionally given up after a course of about an
hour long. Where it flows down N.W. by N., we turned round and
navigated W. by N. out of it back to our encampment. The projecting
shore had deceived me, therefore, when previously passing by, with
respect to the direction of this arm of the Nile. It is called
Kiehr, which is the often-heard kir (water), thence Kirboli, Kirti,
Kiti. There is therefore no doubt that the name of the White
Stream, the main arm of which is called also here Kir-Te, is
originally Te, from Barì to Khartùm, for it is even called Te Uri
by the Nubas, the former word not being used for drinkable water.
The country of these four arms of the Nile is called Kofon,
corresponding to the Arabic mogren (conflux).</p>

<p>I repaired this morning on board Selim Capitan’s vessel, and
shall remain with him to-day, on account of his interpreter. It was
not till this morning that it was at last determined to follow
further the questionable arm of the Nile, which we navigated for a
short tract the day before yesterday. Seven o’clock. We leave our
landing-place, and proceed up the Kièhr in a westerly direction.
After a quarter of an hour the latter serves as a gohr to N.,
appearing soon to disembogue itself into the stream, which we
navigated previously.</p>

<p>We go some paces here S.W., where quite a little island, with
high reeds, rises in the middle of the river. From W. to S.W., from
W. to N.W. The Kièhr seems to be rapid at its tide, and to exercise
great force: we see it by the torn and indented<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_135_v2">[135]</span> shores, and especially by
the devastations on a little gohr, now dry. Half-past seven
o’clock. A broad gohr flows away to N., and winds immediately N.W.
Our river, which increases considerably in breadth above this Nile
arm, winds W.S.W., and S.W. Before us a large forest; near it we
halt immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, a north-wind gets up, and we sail S.S.W., and
S. by E.; after a quarter of an hour, S.W., and W., and with a
short bend, immediately to S. Right and left pastoral villages,
with lowing herds and natives on the ant-hills. The huts have the
form of a bee-hive, are five to six feet high, and plastered with
Nile slime. The ash-grey people dance and jump, and want to keep us
by force. The women run and sing by us, their hands thrown over
their heads in real despair because we will not stop. Half-past
eight o’clock. S. by E. The depth of the water not more than a
fathom. On the left a long summer village and a harim of several
tokuls close to it. We halt a moment at the right shore, take the
wood which the negroes had already brought for us to the shore,
give them some sug-sug, and proceed. The women, with large leathern
aprons, who have gone away empty-handed, jump and make gestures as
if they were mad.</p>

<p>A quarter before nine o’clock, S. Clouds threatening rain. At
the right the forest close at hand. E.S. On the right a large
pastoral village, with plastered beehives, looking like the bakers’
ovens in the land of Sudàn. The cattle stand with their
beautifully-twisted horns, close pressed together, and low at us,
probably because they recognise us as deadly enemies,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_136_v2">[136]</span> and would rather be in the
meadow than waiting here for us. We do not halt for the sake of the
oxen, but on account of the vessels stopping behind, although we
ought to take advantage of the favourable wind, as the water is
falling more and more. Elliàbs are there, who are unarmed, but yet
immediately begin their war-dance. The vessels have, fortunately,
not been stranded, and we sail on at nine o’clock. The village is
called Kiùi or Quùi, and is the boundary of the Elliàbs on the
right side of the river. After a quarter of an hour, E.S.E.
Half-past nine o’clock, S.E. by S., and in a bend to S. A quarter
before ten o’clock, S.S.E., and S.E., where, at the corner, the
crocodiles make a great rustling in the shallow water, and seem to
be engaged in violent combat. At ten o’clock, S.S.E.</p>

<p>I am again very weak to-day, and cannot yet recover myself, for
I want a glass of good wine; every moment I sink back upon the
cushion, and can scarcely hold a pen. The Haba accompanies us
continuously at a slight distance from the right shore. A quarter
after ten o’clock. From S.E. to S.W., and again to S.E. We see many
crocodiles wallowing about in the water, who do not look at us in a
very friendly manner. Half-past ten o’clock. From S.E. by S. to
S.W. The hippopotami, thirteen in number, are crowded like smooth
rocks in the water before us. They spout up the water from anger at
still larger swimming animals approaching, as they may conceive our
vessels to be, for it does not seem that they are in conflict
amongst themselves, or that they want to take the field against the
crocodiles, who are keeping behind us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137_v2">[137]</span>A little
before eleven o’clock some armed ash-grey men shew themselves,
without any ornaments, on the right shore. From S.W. by W. to S. by
W. We halt at the right shore to receive some elephants’ teeth, but
they are too old, and we bear off immediately again to S.E. In the
forest at the right hand we perceive a number of birds and a
considerable herd of gazelles, who stand in an attitude of
curiosity like goats. Up to here the Elliàbs ran after us from the
village of Kiùi. Half-past eleven o’clock. From S.E. by E. to S.,
yet not for long, but to the left S.E. At half-past twelve o’clock.
We halt a second time at the right shore, owing to want of wood. I
saw here a large oval shield of neat’s hide, held simply by a
stick. It belonged to an Elliàb; these shields are said to be used
more in contests with animals than in war. This is perhaps likewise
the case with the few larger shields in the country of Bari.</p>

<p>At half-past one o’clock we navigate again to S.E., and a
quarter before two to S. by E. We see that the forest lies lower
than the shores, and that the water enters it. This local quality
of ground is the case generally, perhaps, in the forests. Either
they lie behind the dam of the old shore, which prevents the mass
of waters of the periodical rains from flowing into the river, or
the Nile enters through the chasms of the shores, if they do not
lie in recesses or old river-beds, where the rain water collects
and remains on the clayey substratum, which is the very same even
as far as the mountains of Bari. How could it be possible else that
these vigorous trees (the Tihl or elephant-tree is particularly
seen here), should<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_138_v2">[138]</span> retain their magnificent verdure
abstractedly from the atmospheric moisture.</p>

<p>Two o’clock. The thermometer this morning 18°, noon 26°, and now
27° Reaumur. From S. to S.S.E. and soon again to S. The north wind
has slackened since noon; we navigate slowly, and must even content
ourselves with libàhn, for no one has yet thought of taming river
buffaloes to tow us in the water itself. Laughable as this may
appear at the moment, yet I do not consider it impossible, for
according to the crew, a young hippopotamus is as tame as a calf.
The apothecary Laskaris possessed shortly before my arrival in
Khartùm such a Nile calf. He wanted to make a vast sum of money by
it, for they had offered in England a reward of some thousand
pounds sterling to any one who would bring a live hippopotamus to
London. It is well known that a living species has never yet been
seen in Europe. His avarice did not allow him, however, to place
the beast in some garden close to the Nile; nor did he provide a
cow and fresh milk. He was even foolish enough to lower it into the
cold cistern, where it died in a few days. Although this primitive
animal was formerly indigenous in Egypt, yet now it very rarely
descends over the cataracts to that country. Mohammed Ali had
received such a beast as a present from Upper Nubia, which was kept
for some years as a curiosity in a reservoir in the Nile at Bulak,
the lower port of Kàhira.</p>

<p>Half-past three o’clock.—From S. to S.E. by S. On the right, in
the badly planted Haba, the first doum-palms again, standing at the
corner, which we pass by at a quarter before three, for a very
short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139_v2">[139]</span> tract to
S.S.W., and equally rapidly S.S.E., to go at three o’clock again
S.S.W., and immediately to S. A half-finished tokul-village rises
very humbly between some old low huts. There were here benches in
the form of couches, which I had not yet seen on the White Stream,
although I had not exactly regretted their absence. They consist of
cudgels, and every single tokul has its seat of repose. Half-past
three o’clock. From S.W. to S. by E. Near the doum-palms, we see
also solitary and unusually high poison-trees in the forest, at the
right hand. The country appears very little populated; perhaps a
sign that we are really in a tributary arm or gohr. This was also
the case even where the Kièhr disembogues near the Elliàbs. The
scantier population may arise, in part, from the more recent lines
of the shore being less constant. The solitary tokuls belong to
fishermen, if we may judge from the sürtuks and fish-baskets set
up. Four o’clock. From S. in a bend to S.E. On the left a long and
miserable village stretches along the shore, with nine carcases of
tokuls, and small tobacco-plantations. This appears also to be a
village of fish-eaters.</p>

<p>Half-past four o’clock. Still the solitary tokuls, with fishing
implements and sürtuks. From S.E. by S., a short tract to S. The
natives are of a friendly disposition, and laughed immoderately,
when the sailors, among whom our Abu Hashis play the principal
part, imitated the cry and laughter of the women. By the short
stakes, which are already sufficiently known to us, we perceive
that their icthyophagism has a flesh-side. They also use the word
matta (lord and king) when they address us. It may,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_140_v2">[140]</span> therefore be a borrowed
word among them; it is said also to be used in Habesh. A quarter
before five o’clock, from S.S.W. to S. by E. A miserable village,
with tobacco-plantations, on the left shore, but the divine smoke
rising close by, asserts the old attractive power of meat. We stop
for a moment, at five o’clock, at the right shore, as if we were
about to land, but the drum is beat, and the tired crew must again
to the rope. S.E. by S. The village at the right shore, before
which a little sycamore hangs over the river, is better built, and
its several magazines testify that the people apply themselves to
agriculture. Half-past five o’clock. At the upper end of the
village the river winds in an arch S.E. by E. We see continually
doum-palms in the forest of the left shore, whereon a village
rises.</p>

<p>At last we are again close to the main stream, and near the
Island of Buko. At sunset we halt at the right shore S.S.E. We see
from hence the trees near which, a few days ago, we lay at anchor
by the village of Buko, and also the village itself, but separated
from it by land, and our gohr,—the presumed river, winds to the
right.</p>

<p>The Liènns dwell here; and the interpreter already dismissed,
Gùmberi, who had left us in Berize, the capital of the Bambers,
came to us again. Clothing appears here to be the privilege only of
the chiefs, for Gùmberi was obliged to take off his red shirt, it
being against the Ethiopian regulations about dress, and he was
asked whether he was a sheikh. (I use here, as throughout my book,
the word sheikh of the Arabic language, as the most significant in
analogous circumstances.) There are many doum-palms<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_141_v2">[141]</span> here, especially young
copse, upon which the sailors pounce, and take the leaves to make
cords of them. I see, to my sorrow, that they do not even spare the
narrow convoluted hearts, which are four to five feet long. The
leaves are plucked, laid in bundles upon a stone, and worked with a
stick, till they are split into fibres; then they are again twisted
together, sorted anew, and laid, like coarse hemp, in the sun to
dry. The very same process takes place with the inside bark of
various trees. I got, subsequently, in the country of the Shilluks,
a small handful of flax, which, according to my Tshauss Marian, was
prepared from the bark of the Baobàb: this tree is called in the
Nuban language, Omràh; its fruit, however, Tabeldi. It is whiter
than flax, shining like raw silk, and feels exactly like the
latter.</p>

<p><em>7th February.</em>—The beating of the doum-leaves goes on
again at daybreak, as if the crew wanted to acquire enormous
treasures by them in Khartùm. It appears as if we shall remain here
to-day, on account of the doum-palms and hunting. Our encampment is
an old bean-field, from which my servants brought me, in a very
short time, a number of beans, quite young, to eat as a salad.
Unfortunately I must begin to be sparing of my vinegar, for it is
truly welcome to me in these regions, as the most refreshing
restorative, although it causes thirst afterwards. I have almost
entirely renounced meat, and live principally on coffee, biscuit
and uèka. The people cannot subsist without this dried bamie, and
therefore my men have laid in a plentiful stock. Rubbed to a meal
on the murhaka, I have it boiled to a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_142_v2">[142]</span> thick pap, with onions and the pepper of
the country, (fillfill bèlladi), and I afterwards pour vinegar over
it. I remarked this morning that Arnaud noted 82° atmospheric
moisture, although the hygrometer has entirely left off working. I
made him comprehend that this was somewhat too much here; he took
the thing, however, as a bagatelle, and said that it would rectify
itself afterwards!</p>

<p>The race of the Liènns, who dwell here, is called Kikin, and the
Tshièrrs live opposite. The Liènns are friendly, and even sociable:
they allow themselves to be joked with, and take the blows with
reeds, which the sailors deal them, as play; but do not venture to
return them. Though these people are inclined generally to jesting,
and merry scenes often take place with our wags, during which the
former are a pattern of good humour, yet they still remain
extremely mistrustful in barter. It is not till they have grasped
the beads firmly in their hands, that they let the goods go which
are to be given for them. I remark that the number of the stippled
lines on their forehead is usually from three to five; we see many
also with quite a smooth forehead. Their weapons are better than
those of the Elliàbs, and they exhibit, on the whole, more wealth,
not only by their ornaments, which, indeed, <em>per se</em>, are
insignificant, but, in particular, by a certain plumpness of body,
denoting better nourishment.</p>

<p>They bring us baskets, very neatly plaited, of split bamboo
reeds, square at the top, and protruding spherically at the bottom.
I get some bows and arrows, perfectly similar to those of Bari. The
arrows, with wooden or bone points, are principally only
destined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143_v2">[143]</span> for the
chase, as also the spears, with barbs. Iron is dear here, and they
did not like, therefore, to sell their javelins, some specimens of
which I had acquired previously. They tell us that there are
several lions in the neighbouring Haba, and want to prevent us from
hunting on that account. We remained on land to-night, with just
confidence in the good disposition of the people, as we had done
previously among the Elliàbs, and set sentinels on the shore.</p>

<p><em>8th February.</em>—I repaired early this morning to the
forest, and returned in two hours, just as Arnaud was setting out,
in company with Suliman Kashef and his men. Suliman altered his
mind suddenly, alleging, as a pretext, the heat; and Arnaud also,
who, before sunrise, was going to slaughter lions and tigers,
composed himself very submissively to return. The doum-palms, if
they do not form a single species, have a meagre appearance, and
but little height; the doum-copse, on the contrary, stands very
luxuriantly, and measures sixty fingers’ breadth in a fan. The
negroes have really no dome-fruit left, and the elephants may have
had the beginning of it, and the gleanings. The poison-trees are
unusually large here.</p>

<p>A tree attracted my attention, by its size and light-coloured
branches, similar to those of the sycamore. Unfortunately it had
lost, like the baobàb, its leaves, except a few. The ends of its
boughs, from which the leaves develope themselves, have buds
similar to those of the chesnut-trees. Mariàn says that this tree
is called Emeddi, and is present on all the mountains of Nuba.
According to him it has small flowers, and little fruits of a
reddish colour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144_v2">[144]</span>
These are as large as clusters of grapes, and hang together in the
same manner, only somewhat looser, are very sweet and eaten. The
elephant-tree (in the language of the Nubas Tihl, or also Or
Omul—Or, tree, omul, elephant) stood in abundant verdure, with long
young fruits. As I now hear, its fruit is eaten by the Nubas only
in case of necessity. If we consider this tree, with its shady roof
of leaves and its magnificent long clusters of flowers and fruits,
we feel inclined to look upon <em>it</em> as the Persea, or arbor
cœlestis of the hieroglyphics, and not the leafless baobàb, which
is mostly a ruin without shade. In Kordofàn, the Or Omul or Tihl
sheds, moreover, its leaves, as the beautifully foliated Emeddi
does here.</p>

<p>Another tree pleased me, which was covered with white flowers,
as if with snow. The small, pointed, and succulent leaves are
something like those of the pear-tree, as well as the tree itself.
Four white leaves are arranged around eighteen long blue stamina.
The fruit is said to be as large as an egg, and is eaten. The tree
is called döbker, and is also indigenous in Nuba. Among the mimosas
we remarked only talle; sunt seems not to present itself at all in
these upper regions. Nearly all the wood of these trees is soft,
and was felled to be worked into pulleys and other things for the
vessels. As the bark of the muddus-tree is better than all the
others for ropes, and does not appear on the great Nile, it was
eagerly sought for. I found also some cotton-trees with small
leaves, in the Haba, which lies tolerably high, and presents an
extensive view. Honey is found here in the ground, and on the
trees, but the little cakes contain only a small
quantity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145_v2">[145]</span> A
large durra-field in the Haba lies, on the whole, high, and falls
away to E. and S.; the soil is strongly mixed with sand. It must
rain here, therefore, for a long time, and continuously, as the
powerful growth of the trees bespeaks, because otherwise durra,
even were it ever so rapid in coming to maturity, could not thrive
without artificial irrigation.</p>

<p>The Tshièrrs live in friendship with the Liènns, whose language
they use, and have the very same <em>insignia</em> of race on their
foreheads. Wherever there are boundaries, such as the river here,
then there appears jealousy and discord. A little slave of Selim
Capitan’s begged to be allowed to throw into the water the other
boy, who was not, like himself, a Tshièrr, but a Liènn, because he
dwelt on the other side of the river. In other respects both these
tribes live in peace; and yesterday a Tshièrr brought us a young
slave-girl purchased from the Liènns, and she was bought in
exchange by Suliman Kashef. We have already become too intimate
with the natives by our two days’ abode for the Turks not to
commence civilising them after their manner. At the head stands
Selim Capitan, who is really earnest about the matter; at his side,
Suliman Kashef, who is not behind the worthy son of Crete in
cultivation, and likes laughing and amusement. The thermometer had
this morning 20°, noon until three o’clock, 27° to 29°, and after
sunset 27° Reaumur.</p>

<p><em>9th February.</em>—At half-past seven o’clock this morning
we leave our encampment, and go by the rope E.S.E., and soon S.E. A
summer village lies at the right shore, and an island in the water,
which is low and covered with green vegetables. Two<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_146_v2">[146]</span> tokuls are upon it,
surrounded with high fish-baskets and hedges of cut simsim, which
appears to be dried in this way. I remark on the island as well as
on the steep disrupt shores, that the lower thick layer of earth
consists of black mould, whilst the middle stratum is red with iron
particles, and the upper one strongly impregnated with sand. The
arable land here appears not to arise from a general deposition,
but has its commencement from the slime of a lake, and the remains
of a subjacent vegetation for its formation. The north wind has set
in, and we navigate round the island in S.W., S.E., and S., and
sail at eight o’clock S. by E. Immediately afterwards S.S.W., a
small island before the forest on the left shore. Eight o’clock,
S.E. Here the island will soon end. Then to S.; solitary farm-yards
on the right and left on the low shores; cultivation before the
rising Haba. A quarter before nine o’clock, S.S.W. The left shore
is covered with young dome-palms, and a large widely scattered
village ascends gradually with the shore to the height of the Haba,
in which we remark a number of large dome-palms. The margin of the
shore stretches flat along the river, and before it lies a
completely shallow island, or peninsula, whereon a quantity of
fishing implements are lying about. Nine o’clock S., then S.S.E.,
and S.E. Right and left, the level land is well cultivated with
durra, simsim, and especially lubiën.</p>

<p>The wind changes after nine o’clock to E. We furl the sails, and
halt at half-past nine o’clock, at the left shore, after we had
first gone a short tract to E. by the rope. There is a very little
isle in the river, and near the trees on the left shore a
hamlet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147_v2">[147]</span> under
which the edge of the shore is also cultivated. From deck we
perceive five other villages, of which one is large, at a slight
distance from the water. The Haba retreats for an hour. At the
right shore are two villages, and the Haba is still further
distant.</p>

<p>The people of the Lienns are, on the whole, poor in ornaments
and weapons, although individuals carry two or three spears, and a
bow with arrows, without quivers, in the left hand. They have the
heads of the spears generally turned towards the ground, which was
not the case further up. This is perhaps rather a sign of friendly
sentiments than their usual custom. They fear, as I saw yesterday
and the day before, even the smacking of the great, long whips,
that the sailors have made from bark for their amusement. They like
to look at the beating of the palm-leaves, and then the sailors
cannot forbear dealing cracking blows right and left, with the
dome-leaves, and running after them. The Liènns understand a joke,
and laugh, run away, and return immediately again to let themselves
be cudgelled anew. They are great children, who are happy at seeing
us and our doings, and playing with the soldiers, although the
jests of the latter are often rude, and at times even end with
plunder.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock.—We proceed with the libàhn E. by S. Half-past ten
o’clock. From S.E. to S.W. At the left lie four villages, tolerably
close together, and on the right rises, at a quarter of an hour
distant, a considerable village between trees, on the gentle height
of the Haba; before it a large level field descends to the edge of
the river. Soon again to the left round to S. by E. A crowd of
natives, amongst whom are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148_v2">[148]</span> also some coloured red, welcome us from
all sides. Our gohr is not above fifty paces broad, but has a
strong fall. Nothing is yet to be discovered of the main stream,
and we begin now to doubt in our very tedious voyage, whether we
did see on the 6th instant our old anchorage at the island of Buko.
A quarter before eleven o’clock, S.E. by S. Not far from the right
shore, a large village, near which we hear the lowing of herds. The
shore is cultivated, and we see there some magazine tokuls, and
whilst we are going S. by E., we perceive from the deck another
large city in the Haba. Opposite, on the left shore, some tokuls,
and a numerous herd of cows.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock. From S.S.W. to S.E. and E.S.E. Half-past eleven.
From E.N.E. to S.E. At twelve o’clock we stop near some tokuls on
the right shore, to allow the crew to eat. The upper boundary of
the Bodshos, who follow the before-mentioned Kikins, is in the
neighbourhood, and the Karboràhs begin here, who also belong, with
the first named tribe, to the nation of the Liènns. They dwell on
both sides of the river, and live at war with each other. In a
quarter of an hour we move on again, and go in short bends S. by
E., E.S.E., S.E., and S.S.W. From the deck—four villages on the
right, and three on the left. Half-past twelve o’clock. For a
finger’s length to S.E., and then S and S.W.; a quarter before one
to S. One o’clock, S.S.E. On the left two villages seen from the
deck; on the right an island, covered with high grass. We must
think no more of an island of Buko, for this gohr is said by the
negroes to lead up to the mountains; and I had therefore heard
quite correctly, at the very beginning, near the Kofon
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149_v2">[149]</span> the Elliàbs
and Bohrs, where this very same thing was said plainly enough.</p>

<p>If we suppose that we shall again be connected with other arms
of the Nile, for we were near such a one on the 6th inst., which I
still hold to be that of the island of Buko, our return voyage,
with the present waste of time, might become more difficult than is
expected. We should be obliged to wait for the commencement of the
hariff (rainy season), or to seek to regain King Làkono’s sympathy,
which we have forfeited. The want of good bread-corn, already
beginning to be felt, is the only thing that makes me fear the crew
would not then be induced to follow further the White Stream beyond
Bari.</p>

<p>The Abu Hashiff of Suliman Kashef proclaimed this morning a
punishment of five hundred blows of the cudgel to any soldier or
sailor who should be found to have delayed slaughtering his goats
or sheep till to-morrow. They had collected together at different
times, by purchase, theft, and robbery, several beasts, whom they
were fattening with durra, to sell them in Khartùm.</p>

<p>Sand-banks also appear with the increase in width of the gohr,
and render the navigation difficult. A quarter before two o’clock,
a short tract, S.S.W. and W.S.W. Two o’clock, W. by S. A broad gohr
flows here from our arm to S.E., and makes the land at our left a
large island. We go, however, up the stream, and wind W.S.W., where
we halt at the right shore. It is asserted very positively that we
have navigated up and down that broad gohr flowing from here, and
that therefore the continued ascending in the gohr, in which we are
at this moment, and which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_150_v2">[150]</span> also is becoming broader, has no object.
It matters not, however, whether we are blind and do not see, or
whether we see as we wish, so that we only go again downwards. Our
river arm has suddenly here again a width of three hundred paces.
This, as well as the depth of the water, speaks, certainly, in
favour of the sailors’ opinion, that we are again on the main
stream. The supreme council would fain, of course, assent to this
opinion, but, to my great astonishment, I hear it is very much
feared that we shall lose our way in another stream territory, and
not come out at all by Khartùm. In order to prevent our returning
by the very same road in our gohr, I propose to navigate up even as
far as the mountains, to set ourselves right, or at least to find
some memorials, such as a village or natives that we had seen
previously. Our men, however, put no more confidence in what the
latter say, and the crocodiles and hippopotami give us no
intelligence. The blue-green broken corals which we had found
already in the kingdom of Bari, are still the same here, and are
preferred by far to those of a white colour.</p>

<p>At half-past two o’clock a north-east wind set in, which blew
the <em>wise council</em> asunder. A short tract to E.S.E. by the
rope, and we sail then S.W. by S. in a flat arch to S.W. with two
miles’ course. The shores are low and only three to four feet high.
The green forest developes itself behind the slender, half-dried
reeds. A quarter after three o’clock. From S.W. with a short bend
to E.S.E.; at half-past three o’clock E. by N., and at four o’clock
S.W. by W. The shores have been for a long time without
cultivation, and only here and there we see some
negroes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151_v2">[151]</span> but yet
there are two large villages, a quarter of an hour distant from the
left shore.</p>

<p>It is scarcely four o’clock when Fadl tells me from the mast
that he sees a high mountain W.S.W. I remark its peak also
immediately from the deck. To judge by the outline of it, it
appears to be the Nerkanjin, but I do not wish it, as I would
rather see another beautiful mountain country. Whilst we are
sailing S.S.W. a gohr issues on the right from our mysterious river
to W.N.W., and makes, therefore, the land at our right, a large
island. What a happy combination of natural canals, and what
nations may be still drinking of this water! A quarter after four
o’clock, S.E. by S. Right and left a village on the shores. There
are low tokuls with clay walls and square doors: the roof consists
of leaves of the dome palm. Their large baskets are also composed
of the hearts of these trees. The village of the right shore has
many open tokuls or cattle-stalls, and enters tolerably far into
the land, where we observe several herds. Half-past four o’clock.
From S.E., with the broad beautiful bend of the river to S. by E.
At five o’clock we stop opposite a large village on the right
shore, where many natives are collected. The thermometer, 20°, 28°,
30°, and 27° Reaumur.</p>

<p><em>10th February.</em>—At the first sight of the morning dawn
we heard the great wooden kettle-drum (nogàra) sounding opposite in
the large village of Karborah, which instrument is beaten for
amusement, as well as for driving out the cattle. The watch-houses
of the cow-herdsmen stand in the centre of the enormous herd; the
employment of these men may be taken in turns like that of the
night-watch. The tribe<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_152_v2">[152]</span> of the Karboràhs, who, as I have said
before, are a branch of the Liènns, and independent, is here
likewise not entirely stippled on the forehead. Yesterday evening
we traded with them, and I received many a pretty thing,
principally of iron; for they dwell nearer the mountains, the
source of iron wealth. Thus, I purchased ivory bracelets, with
black streaks; bows of bamboo, with iron ends, and narrow bands of
iron; ropes of bark, which, according to Mariàn, are from the
muddus-tree, and the strongest; some hair-lines, said to be made
from giraffes; thin iron chains, which they sling round their ribs;
but I could neither see a kettle-drum nor an antelope-horn for
blowing. It was with much trouble that I got a surprisingly
beautiful little he-goat, with a head like a gazelle, although the
other little goats have compressed noses. Selim Capitan was looked
upon here also as our matta; and they wanted to take by force a
large elephant’s tooth, which I had already bought, to present to
him, not returning, however, my thick glass beads. Several Nile
buffaloes are found in the river—a sign in the present season of
the year, that agriculture is diligently attended to in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, we set off from S. to S.W.; a quarter before
nine o’clock, from S.E. by S. to S.S.E.; on the left a hamlet. A
quarter after nine o’clock, S.E.; and we sail with the good east
wind immediately again S. and S.S.W., and make three miles.
Half-past nine o’clock, S.E. Cultivation at the right side, and a
watch-house in the tobacco plantations. It seems as if tobacco were
considered, in the opinion of our people, an article of luxury
which may be taken whenever<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_153_v2">[153]</span> they like, without injustice. The
tobacco plantations are sheltered here also with reed-mats erected
on sticks three feet high, as a protection against the scorching
solar rays. Immediately again S. Dancing, clapping, huzzaing, and
young girls and women singing on the right shore.</p>

<p>A quarter before ten o’clock. From S.S.W. to S.E. The wind is
very contrary, and drives us together to the right shore, where we
make use of the rope for a short time. The merry girls and women
are adorned with rings and necklaces; only the head is shaved, as
in the other places, and they wear no rings in their ears. They
have the sitting-skin already mentioned behind, and the narrow
rahàt before. Moreover, most of them are armed with bows and
arrows, probably for self-defence in the absence of the men. A
quarter after ten o’clock. We sail again to S. We remark no
villages, and yet there are several people on the right shore; the
habitations seem, therefore, to be up the country in the Haba. It
was not till after a quarter of an hour that a large village
appeared: soon afterwards a second, the inhabitants of which have
collected on the right shore. About eleven o’clock we double a
little island on the right, and at the left a broad gohr, with a
strong fall, flows in from S.E.; near it lies a still smaller
island, like a grass-shield, bulging out in the middle, which we
also leave on the left. Half-past eleven o’clock. From S. Libàhn,
E.S.E. Herds right and left; shady roofs on four stakes. My men
have bought a large wooden drum for me, and throw it down the
shore; but several natives, who are against the sale, jump after
it, and take it back by force; it seems to be the property
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154_v2">[154]</span> the
community. Twelve o’clock. From E.S.E to S.S.W. In the background
an island ascends.</p>

<p>The negroes wear frequently small animals’ skins on their heads,
which hang down over the nape of their necks. The sun has as
injurious an effect here on the former as on the vertebral columns
of the latter. A quarter of an hour later to S., and our corpulent
friend, Mount Nerkanjin, steps forward from S.W., blue and boldly,
from the background over the above-named island, near which a gohr
flows from W.S.W. At half-past twelve o’clock we lie to at the
right shore, near the same, to let the men rest and eat. I could
not tell what made me so hot, but the thermometer shews just 33°,
although this morning it was only 20°, as usual. We only stop
twenty minutes, and the poor crew must again to the rope, S.S.E.
After one o’clock, we halt a second time near a little island, the
narrowest arm of which we soon follow, on account of the greater
depth. The current in this canal, which has fifty to sixty paces,
is uncommonly strong. Two o’clock.—From S.S.E. to S.W. by S., and
immediately to the left S. by E., and right S.S.W. A quarter after
two o’clock.—A magnificent east wind: we shall make four miles to
S. by W. and S.S.W.; but it slackens immediately after casting out
the log, and only refreshing breezes breathe through the windows.
In order to get from this place, we assist the hoisted sails by
libàhn. A small island before us closes the narrow reach of our
course, which our ship, until half-past two, nearly fills up. Three
o’clock, S.E. by S, and on the right round a corner S.S.W., a few
paces, then immediately left to S., where we stop a moment.
“El<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155_v2">[155]</span> Bah’r
kebir!” our people are shouting on all sides; for they take the
broad stream, wherein we are now sailing, for the White Nile
itself. An arm separates from it to N.N.W.; the last land on the
right is therefore also an island. We go by the left shore of the
main stream, where it winds from S.S.W. to E.N.E. It is called
here, as up the river, Kirboli, and both sides of it are inhabited
by the Elliàbs; therefore there is no doubt that it is the main
stream. The great island just mentioned is called Tui. We proceed
at four o’clock to S.S.W., and Mount Nerkanjin remains in a
south-westerly direction as previously. Half an hour later, we go
from S.S.W. to S.; still no village, nor familiar tree appears;
even the sailors begin again to doubt—for aught I care,—only
forward; so that at last it must be resolved to wait for the rainy
season. At half-past four o’clock S.S.E.; we halt on the sand, and
no one appears to be sure of his point, least of all Arnaud, who
cannot comprehend his own journal.</p>

<p>Every doubt is removed, after considerable questioning of the
natives; we return a quarter before five o’clock from this ascent,
and stop above the Kièhr, which we had come up from the White Nile,
in order to examine it, even to its issue, and had taken hitherto
for an independent mountain stream. At six o’clock we go to the
neighbouring island, between the Nile and the gohr Kièhr. At sunset
29°; this will be a hot night.</p>

<p><em>11th February.</em>—We remain near the large island of Tui,
make a section of the Nile, and find the main stream below the bay,
where it divides into three arms, a hundred and twenty-eight mètres
broad. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156_v2">[156]</span> is
called here Landofò; the Kokis inhabit its left shore. The Liénns
possess the right, together with our island, and the shores of the
gohrs, between which is the island of Tobo. Only a few of the
latter tattoo the forehead; some, the shoulders, as far as the
upper part of the arm; and others, the upper part of the back: some
have also coloured themselves with ochre.</p>

<p><em>12th February</em>—Observations are to be made also to-day,
in order to start in the afternoon. I purchase for a few large
glass beads, the first <em>fine</em> elephant’s tooth, and I design
it, being the largest of all, as a cabinet specimen for my country.
Now, at last, it is evident to every one, that we are navigating
back our old road. It is fortunate for me that I am able to set up
continuously and write my journal, affected as I am with fever all
the day after the hot nights. At half-past two o’clock we bear off,
and reach at half-past four the end of the island of Tobo, near
which we land at sunset by the left shore, having made four miles
and a half with a strong current, and the stroke of the oar.
Thermometer, in the morning, 20°; noon, 32°; evening, 30°.</p>

<p><em>13th February.</em>—We are to set out half an hour after
sunrise; in the meantime the men are slaughtering in haste some
cows, which natives of uncommon size have brought us. We do not
proceed, therefore, till seven o’clock, in a north-westerly
direction. The river makes such short bends that we bound every
moment against the shore, notwithstanding the very strong fall, and
we tear off also a corner of the loose earth. This, as well as the
carelessness in steering, causes the vessel to draw water
continually. Nine<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_157_v2">[157]</span> o’clock. We stop at the left shore, near
some dome-palms; the water is a little deeper here, as if a broad
arm of the Nile, from E.S.E., joins with our narrow one, or we with
it. Here also they bring us cotton for sale. Eleven o’clock. We go
on with a favourable east wind. The tokuls for dwellings are the
peristyles already described. At noon we see several hippopotami,
some of them real monsters; these may remain here pretty
constantly, being perhaps their hunting district, because the river
is, on the whole, of great depth in this place.</p>

<p>We get on a sand-bank, close to which several crocodiles are
encamped. The first of these beasts (in truth a fearful leader)
attacks the men who are pushing the vessel off the sand-bank; then
a soldier jumps overboard, armed only with a hatchet (Chadàn),
boldly meets it, and really drives it back into the water. At this
moment shots were fired by the soldiers on board the vessels at the
whole congregation, but so badly aimed that not one remained dead
on the spot; they all made a slow retreat into the water, and we
found afterwards, in the moist sand on the shore, fifty-three of
their eggs lying together all of a layer. The shells were a little
broken, as if cracked, which may be caused by the sun and the humid
sand. At first I thought, indeed, that these eggs might be near
hatching; but I was persuaded of their freshness, when the crew eat
them, roasted in ashes, with much goût. I tried also a little one,
and found the usual taste of eggs, only it seemed to me
particularly dry, and the white was more spongy and not compact. My
servants had preserved eight of the eggs, which I put among
those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158_v2">[158]</span> found in
the neighbourhood of the crocodile shot by Suliman Kashef. I see
that the latter are smaller, but thicker and rounder than the
first-named. In general they do not exceed the size of a goose’s
egg, and differ from birds’ eggs, especially by both ends being
uniformly arched. When I compared these eggs subsequently, in
Khartùm, with another one, found by me lying openly in the sand of
the shore of the united stream, on our journey to Sennaar, I found
the latter to be considerably larger than those of the White
Stream. Without wishing to decide by this on the different species
of crocodiles, I remark that the people here well know that there
are such distinctions. At one o’clock, we halt at the right shore,
near a pastoral village, but do not find the expected oxen. About
five o’clock we push off again, and a Nile arm divides to N.E.;
then comes another from S.E., and winds E.S.E. This is the arm,
according to the general assertion, which we previously
ascended.</p>

<p><em>14th February.</em>—We at eight o’clock, navigate, the gohr,
which is new to us, and goes from N. to N.W. Right and left dwell
the Elliàbs; also on both shores of the gohr from whence we came.
The Tshiérrs follow the Elliàbs; their boundary is determined by
some dome-palms. The former made, yesterday, a marauding and
murderous attack on the island-land enclosed by the gohr, and
killed several men; they were, however, put to flight by the
Elliàbs, who hastily collected, and were driven over the water, by
which they left three dead. The Elliàbs mean now to make a great
war against them, and would not, on that account, sell us any of
the few spears which these<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_159_v2">[159]</span> poor pastoral people possess. The Kièhrs
dwell, according to the inquiries made by Selim Capitan over the
island, on the right shore of the Nile arm, which we ascend, the
river being also called there Kièhr, as we have already mentioned.
This circumstance may have led Selim wrong, for the Bohrs dwell
there, as I ascertained with the assistance of my Jengàh. After a
quarter of an hour, we again stop close to the left shore, where
our river-arm, called here the Kir, flows to N.W. Hardly any people
come to us, and the few we see are dirty, covered with ashes, and
without ornaments. Their spears, small in number, are however kept
polished, as the negroes generally clean carefully every thing
pertaining to weapons, and iron decorations, except when they have
coloured red with ochre their entire bodies, and then every thing
they carry on them and with them is dyed with the same colour. We
see clouds, foreboders of rain, almost uninterruptedly in the sky.
Thermometer, at sunrise, 21°; from twelve to three o’clock not more
than 30°, at sunset 29°. The Frenchmen add still more degrees, and
see also more, in order to frighten their readers at such a
country.</p>

<p>We go, after a short halt, to the right shore, where there is a
large cattle village, with many sleeping-places and plastered
bee-hives, or tokuls, their tops being lightly covered with straw
or reeds: large herds there. We navigate, with the stern of the
vessel foremost, although the captain is on deck, towards N.N.W.,
and shall halt immediately at the left shore near a little pastoral
village. The red colour of the large heaps of ashes arises only
from the burnt cows’ dung. 3 o’clock. Selim Capitan has just
returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160_v2">[160]</span> after a
long voyage downwards. No water; therefore libàhn again, back into
the gohr traversed previously. I procured to-day, from the
herdsmen, four heavy breakers of beads or hassaeis of ebony,
without ornament; and I see also here old woollen morions, of which
I possess already one specimen. The Frenchmen still keep their
windows hung with curtains or closed, so as not to be disturbed by
the exterior world. At half-past four o’clock we are so fortunate
as to enter our old gohr E.S.E., and come soon to the old
encampment (I am again ill, as I was then,) turn the bow foremost,
go N.W., and stop at sunset to N. at the left shore. I purchase a
miserable little stool, which is rare here, from the Elliàbs.</p>

<p><em>15th February.</em>—I have received, from Selim Capitan, a
Bohr, as drogman, but he will do nothing at first, for he is too
hungry. The river flows at half-past six, and up to seven o’clock,
continually to N., with declinations to N.W., where a small island
appears on the right. Again N.; on the left a large pastoral
village of the name of Uadir, belonging to the Elliàbs, or as our
Bohrs call them, Alliababe. The Bohrs possess the right shore,
between whom and the Elliàbs eternal war prevails. N.N.W.: on the
left a little island. Half-past seven o’clock. Over the dry straw
of the shore on the left green copse is sprouting, the tree-tops of
the neighbouring forest. Some drops of rain fell to-night on
Feïzulla Capitan’s fiery brandy-nose, as if on a hot stone, while
he was sleeping on deck; now, also, I feel some drops on my cool,
pale nose. A fine prospect! for neither are our corn magazines well
covered, nor our cabins air-tight above, thanks to Selim Capitan’s
negligence. From N.N.E. immediately<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_161_v2">[161]</span> again N.N.W. Eight o’clock. Right and
left a forest, preceded by a narrow border of the shore. A little
island on the right displays its green margin of reeds and
creepers, as we see in all of them. We halt at the sandy right
shore: the left is fertile soil, which is also the case on the
right, though only for a short tract. Suliman Kashef’s mallem was
buried here the preceding year, and Suliman visited now his grave
under the trees. Opposite to us lies the tolerably large pastoral
village of Kelagò, a portion of which only I draw, because it is
like all the others. Thibaut also has applied himself to the ivory
trade; he has just acquired three elephants’ teeth. Half-past nine
o’clock. Away to N. and N.W.; at ten o’clock, a small pastoral
village on the left, with ash-grey people. The forest extends at
one side, and was refreshing to us, with its various tints of
green. Here and there the sun breaks through the clouds, and casts
picturesque gleams of light around; I can even enjoy it, for I feel
myself again better after the very strong perspiration I had in the
night.</p>

<p>The Bohrs have lines on their foreheads like the Elliàbs, not
waved, however, like the latter, but straight, and also broader.
The drogman has five, which appear to consist of double lines. A
quarter after ten o’clock, N.N.W.; to the left an islet, with
flowering creepers and reeds. We are welcomed with a song, for this
is the usual custom with the tribes below Bari. One leads the
choir, and the chorus joins continually with “jok, jok, are o jok;”
but they have several refrains, among which their “abande jok”
should not be forgotten. At eleven o’clock N., uninterruptedly,
like our direction, with the former deviations to W.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_162_v2">[162]</span> and E., the eternal
enumeration of which would only be tiresome. I know enough of the
previous ascent to be able to control my French companions. We stop
at half-past twelve o’clock at the right shore by the Haba, and
push off at half-past one again to N.N.W. The nation of the Bors,
or Bohrs, is likewise poor, and nothing was to be purchased from
them but some teeth, which Matta Selim Capitan appropriated to
himself. The tribes hitherto seen have, on the whole, the same sort
of weapons, although some arms are only similar; everywhere we see
solitary spears, similar to those of Bari. It seems generally that
all iron work is manufactured in that country, according to the
taste of the different tribes, which is frequently indeed very bad,
and sent away from thence; many, however, may have been introduced
by intercourse with nations dwelling at their side. It is a cool
north-west wind.</p>

<p>Thermometer, Sunrise 23° to 24°. Noon 27°. A quarter of an hour
later an island five minutes long shews itself to the left in the
middle of the river. We go N.N.W. At the foot of this island,
another one, small and low, and, as it appeared to me at first,
cultivated; but this, however, was not subsequently confirmed. Our
course passes between yellow and light-green copse and other trees.
Only here and there, there is still a dome-palm, quite small or
young; yet they probably serve for the canoes here, for I observed
several of these boats on the shore. Two o’clock. N.W. An island in
the centre of the river which we leave at our right; then N.N.W. I
have convinced myself, by <em>new</em> ant-hills, that these
insects, which are somewhat larger here than the common ant, raise
the earth from a depth where it is entirely<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_163_v2">[163]</span> wet, black, and without admixture of
sand (such as on the level of the Nile, and in its neighbourhood),
to make their buildings durable. On the other hand, I remember the
fallen-down craters of the ant-hills among the Dinkas. It is now
evident to me that they openly seek a protection against the
weather by getting under the trees when there are any in their
neighbourhood. The shores shew here already a little oxyde earth.
Half past two o’clock. From N.N.E. to N., whereupon we halt at the
right shore; for the Frenchmen want to go hunting.</p>

<p><em>16th February.</em>—Thermometer yesterday evening, 24°; this
morning, 19°. I made an excursion into the interesting forest: it
lies upon slightly-elevated sandy bottom, on which the dome-palms
do not grow so luxuriantly as in the country of the Tshièrrs, where
I counted sixty lances on one leaf, whilst here there are only from
forty-two to forty-six. I had preserved previously a vegetable,
though not knowing the nature of its root: here the sailors grubbed
up some of the same sort, and I saw tubers on them three feet and a
quarter thick, running towards the upper part to a round form, but
appearing to branch out below like enormous roots. Slender roots
shoot from these main tubers, and on them rises an
insignificant-looking vegetable, a foot high, covered at the top
with small oval pale-green leaves, like those of the box-tree: the
clusters of gossamer-flowers are of a yellowish colour. It is
called “Irg-el-moje” (water-root)—in Nuban, “Otto;” is very full of
juice, but of a nauseous, sweet taste, and is sold in Kahira. The
suckers, properly speaking, must by virtue of the soil here, go to
a great depth. Our liquorice tastes perhaps<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_164_v2">[164]</span> better, owing to its dryness. The
large specimens were cut to pieces and torn, by reason of their
softness, and in consequence of the greediness of our crew, who are
like children, and yet laugh at the blacks. I took a specimen for
myself. The beautiful red peas or vetches were also found. This
vegetable was gathered; but no one at first knew the foliage, until
I discovered at last a few slender tendrils of vetches, which were
still green, and hung together with the dry peas in the pods, which
were burst open. The blacks and men of Belled Sudàn make use of
them as an ornament. They are small, hard, and rough, like beads,
have a black eye, with a white and scarcely visible line, and are
called hap-el-arùss (bride-grain). I have in my possession several
of them. The anduràb or enderàb, a large tree with willow-like
laciniated bark, is very common here: it has little green clusters
of flowers on its lower branches, hanging in wild disorder; small
round fruit, at present green, and willow-like, yet truncated
leaves. Besides many other trees, such as talles, geïlids, and
others, there is also a very large tree, now thoroughly leafless,
deserving notice, from its short prickles, and little apples.
Mariàn tells me that it has small round leaves, which make their
appearance in the hariff, together with a white flower, and that it
is called, in the Nuban language, dakuin. The fruit is not eaten,
but gathered green, and strung round the necks of children, as a
preventive against fever and other diseases.</p>

<p>We do not perceive grass anywhere, and therefore there are not
any cattle or human beings; but there may be, perhaps, many wild
beasts. Wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165_v2">[165]</span>
buffaloes, as I had been assured previously in the upper Haba, and
several of which animals Suliman Kashef and Capitan Mohammed Agà,
the Arnaut, with the halberdiers of the former, pretend to have
seen, are said to be frequently found here, and larger than those
of Egypt. We are more inclined to believe this assertion, because
it is well known to all our blacks that such beasts often appear
among the Shilluks, Hassanïes, and elsewhere. This animal is called
“Gamùs el galla.”</p>

<p>This morning, unfortunately, a soldier was stabbed by a Bohr
with a spear, because, as I suspect, he was about to take it away
from the latter according to the favourite Belesh manner, that is,
without paying for it. We were magnanimous, and did not take any
revenge on another Bohr, who was dragged to us instead of the
proper criminal. So likewise I see the <em>voluntary</em> slaves of
Selim Capitan chained together on the shore. At one o’clock we
leave our beautiful landing-place. On the left a little village
appears, then also a Haba; but it is too scantily furnished with
trees, and soon retreats ashamed before the magnificent forest
opposite. After some minutes a reed island divides the river. Then
we proceed with W.N.W., our sails swollen by the east wind, and
leave it to the right whilst we go more westerly, but soon again N.
The burning of the reeds has an unpleasing effect to the eye, but
the country rises new-born like a phœnix from the ashes. The island
is fifteen minutes long. Half-past one o’clock. From N.E. by E. to
W. by S. A hamlet in the Haba to the right of the shore, which is
here high and precipitously disrupt, owing to the narrow
pass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166_v2">[166]</span> lies
picturesquely. A quarter before two o’clock, N.W., on the right a
little island. At two o’clock from N.E. to N.W. in the bend, but
the Haba has disappeared. A quarter after two o’clock N.N.E.; on
the right an island ten minutes long. At the end of it N.E.; on the
left an old village containing tokuls with six to seven
indentations on the roofs. The Haba, with several dhellèbs, has
approached us on the avulsed high shore; it shews the genuine marks
of the ancient or high shores. Half-past two o’clock, near the bend
to N.W.; on the right many dhellèbs, which are not, however, of
remarkable appearance, especially as the lower dry branches are
upon them. A quarter before three o’clock. From the short E.N.E.
tract to N.N.W. The forest on the right rises upon sandy deposits
of downs, somewhat in the form of a hill. The sand was once
deposited, perhaps, by an unusual inundation, on the underwood, and
has remained there since that time. The shores are still intermixed
with ochre here and there. A glistening long course before us
towards N.N.W., such as we had not had for a long time, with the
exception of the small inlets right and left; also a little island
there. Thermometer 19° and 29° to 30°. Three o’clock. The Haba has
retreated, yet N.N.W. On the left a small tokul village as before;
immediately under it to the right E.N.E. and W.N.W., again a
forest, the only break of the monotonous shores, islands, and
villages. A quarter after three o’clock. From a short westerly
direction to N.N.W. We halt at the right shore; perhaps Selim
Capitan’s vessel draws water—yet, no; the French gentlemen had not
come up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167_v2">[167]</span>A quarter
after four o’clock: off again, and we go N.E. On the right side
Bohrs, and on the left Elliàbs. Half-past four o’clock, N.W. The
Haba on the right rises on downs; we see dome-palms also on it, but
upon firm, dark earth, whilst the sand lies only on the surface.
Moreover, these dome-palms are considerably higher than the
dhellèbs. Violent storms cannot take place in these regions; I have
never seen a single tree torn up by the wind. A quarter before five
o’clock, from N.E. to N.N.W. The Haba remains and consoles us more
than sufficiently for the arid shore, although green reeds and
weeds struggle up here and there, and strike the roots deep into
the vivifying water.</p>

<p>To N.N.W., a long row of tokuls appears in parade before us,
without any other background than the horizon. On the right a
narrow arm goes to E., and places the barren tokul-city on an
island. In the bend from N.W. to W. The tokuls have, in part, the
screen mentioned before, as the entrance; the sleeping-places in
the neighbourhood are built of new reeds, and sixty tokuls without
sleeping-places, and huts join them. This place, inhabited by
Bohrs, is called Jemàhl. Immediately to the left also, by N.W, a
tokul-village opposite; the lower walls, being proportionably high,
are partly plastered with Nile slime. The knowledge of my drogman
Joi is already at an end: he does not know the name of this long
village, lying on the margin of the river like a crescent. Five
o’clock from S.W. to N.E. by N. I remark the circumference of a red
cone of ashes in the centre part of the broken shore:
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168_v2">[168]</span> reeds brush
the vessel, and some of them fall on the plank before my
window.</p>

<p>That custom of dung-fires for the encampment of the herds
already mentioned, appears very ancient; for the earth deposited by
the river lies from three to four feet high near them. About sunset
we stop, on account of good neighbourhood, near a pastoral village
on the right shore, where the river winds to N. The goats and sheep
jump from the vessels with delight to the green grass on the shore.
We hoped to get some oxen here, but not any were brought us.</p>

<p><span class="sc">17th February</span>.—The thermometer, hanging
in the window, which is always open, had, at about half-past eight
o’clock yesterday evening, 25½°, and this morning before sunrise
23°. The sky is cloudy, and it seems as if it would rain; the east
wind abates the sultriness a little. At seven o’clock, from N.E. to
E. by S., and immediately northerly. A quarter after seven o’clock,
W.N.W., N.E., and then in a bend to N.N.W. The Bohr Joi was
extremely happy yesterday evening; he had eaten so much that he
could not move: I had repaired the broken bowl of his pipe, and he
smoked my tobacco and said, “affat” (good). Feïzulla Capitan has
given him the usual slave name of “Bachit,” by which he is called
and teazed on all sides. The Dinkaui Bachit, a young soldier, who
might speak to him, will have<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_170_v2">[170]</span> nothing to do with him; therefore the
fellow finds himself deserted, and cannot answer by words the crew,
who are always laughing at him. Even yesterday he hung down his
head the whole day, and looked on the ground, and I could not help
feeling pity for the otherwise free negro, separated as he was from
his friends. He had a handsome head, something of a Roman nose,
large eyes, a mouth only protruding a little, and all his teeth,
except the four lower ones; in other respects he was thin, seemed
in grief, and almost starved to death. This might have induced him
perhaps to come on board Selim Capitan’s vessel, who bound a piece
of linen as an ornament round his neck, but retained him as a
slave. Awakened from my sleep, I heard him speaking and singing,
looking with passionate affection towards both shores. I think the
poor creature is taking leave of his country, or he is home-sick,
and owing to that cannot sleep. At midnight he woke me a second
time, and screamed Bohr, Bohr, Bohr! and then, Elliàb, Elliàb,
Elliàb! adding clearly thereto individual names, whilst he turned
himself to those regions. He sang loud, melancholy songs, and what
appeared from the melody to be the camel-song of the Bisharis, and
then shouted wildly and loudly. They tried to hold him fast, but he
was as strong as a lion. Subsequently he complained of pains in the
body, which perhaps arose from his dreadful gluttony, and he gazed
continually at the shores as if assistance would come to him from
thence. I suppose that he wants to escape, and therefore I made him
take off the linen decoration, as it might be an obstacle to him in
so doing; but I got him first to rub his stomach with
it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171_v2">[171]</span> during which
operation he roared and groaned like a wild beast, and stretched
himself with both hands on the lowered mast. Scarcely, however, was
he relieved from the attack of colic than he made a tremendous
spring over the heads of the crew right away into the water. It was
with difficulty that I prevented them from firing at him. Feïzulla
Capitan did not say a word, but put on a melancholy face, because
he feared possibly Selim Capitan’s reproaches.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock, N.N.W., and after fifteen minutes with a short
course to S.S.E. and again N.W. and N.N.W. On the right, a village,
with numerous light-coloured cows and open sleeping-places; between
them, little huts for women and children, formed like a basket,
plastered with slime, and covered at the top with entangled
couch-grass, which may serve as a covering against the weather, or
as a chimney. The north wind, which has set in, is contrary to us,
and we are, at a quarter before nine o’clock, when we are going to
the north, scarcely five minutes from the last villages. We
continually run aground, and spin like a top from one shore to the
other, on account of the north wind, which is blowing stronger and
stronger: the ashes of the burnt grass are carried up by the wind,
and the air all around is obscured by them. The river winds from N.
towards N.E., and at the corner on the right is a large pastoral
village, with several lowing herds; on the left, a tokul village,
in which, on account of the north and east wind, we do not see any
of the oval doors turned towards the Nile. A number of ugly and
dirty women with leather aprons, also boys, but no girls, stand
collected there. Above this women’s village a gohr<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_172_v2">[172]</span> disembogues from S.W. by
S., and this is the same arm of the Nile that Selim Capitan
navigated for three hours, above, near the Elliàbs, and found unfit
for our voyage. We stop at half-past nine o’clock at the lower end
of the long pastoral village extending along the shore. An old man
seizes the rope by which we have lately been pulled, and makes us
understand that he is going to kill some cows for us. We move on,
however, for they did not come before eleven o’clock, to N.W.</p>

<p>The village is called Dirèk, also Aderèk. Three natives were on
board our vessel: their felt morions were covered over and over
with sea-shells (<i>Cypræa moneta</i>), and the inside so entwined
with their hair, that they could not take them off without cutting
off the hair itself; therefore we could not persuade any of them to
sell us their caps. At last one man asked a large shellful of glass
beads for it. Another fellow was brought to Selim Capitan, but he
would not resign his morion for any price, and said that he
purchased it for eight cows, and that it came from the very distant
country of Kekèss. Hence it follows that there is a connection here
with the sea. Eleven o’clock; a little to N.E. by N. A quarter
after eleven o’clock, with a short bend to N.W. by W., and N. by E.
In the angle of this second sharp bend, on the left a small
pastoral village; then N.E. The reddish-colour of the ashes seems
to arise from the natural admixture of the clayey soil, as I
convinced myself to-day, when the men were piling together the dung
of the herds. Half-past eleven o’clock. From N.E. to N.W.: then a
Nile arm shews itself in the bend to E., and flows
southerly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173_v2">[173]</span> The
smell of fire from the black and scorched shores is very
unpleasant, on which, however, there are still green spots and
tracts. The disrupt and higher old shore stretches to the right, in
a straight line to N.N.E., whilst the present shore goes westerly.
A quarter before twelve. In the bend from W.N.W. to N.E. by N.: on
the left shore a pastoral village, with sleeping-places, or
inclined reed-walls, turned towards W., and open at the top; small
basket-huts and regular tokuls join, having roofs indented, or
rather in the form of steps.</p>

<p>I cannot yet get the negro Joï out of my mind, with his
melancholy melodies and Swiss home-sickness, which lasted for
hours. The sudden, wild outbreak of the passionate feelings of man
in a state of nature—the shouting of names, and the continual
repetition of them dying away with the voice—never, never have I
heard a more affecting <em>decrescendo</em>! Then again his rude
speech and cries; and then the songs, which I took for pastoral
songs, and which in part have the <em>very same melody</em>, with
their softly humming and tremulous key-note as the camel-songs of
the Bisharis, heard throughout the night in the desert, only that
the former expressed the higher notes more passionately, where his
voice often broke, but always returned again to the key-note. The
calling individual names, by which his heart turned even to his
enemies the Elliàbs, bringing to mind his misfortune in the dark
cloudy night—every thing is still present before me. I offered him
glass beads; staccato and hoarse notes alone were his answer. The
Swiss style of singing is known in the interior of Africa, as I
previously ascertained from hearing the young soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174_v2">[174]</span>Twelve
o’clock. From N.N.W. and N.W. by W. to N.W. The shores are no
longer mixed with sand, although there are lower imbenchings and
aggregations: on the left, a pastoral village, where we see, as
usual, a crowd of negroes. At half-past twelve o’clock, N.N.W.: we
halt at the right shore. They bring me small tubers, similar to
potatoes, and eaten like them; opposite to us a pastoral village.
We bear off again at a quarter before one o’clock. At one, from N.
to N.W.: on the left, a village with old tokuls. A very long
watercourse lies before us, and at the end of it, at two o’clock, a
pastoral village, in the form of an arch, and extending to some
distance. We double a short corner on the right, N.E. by N., near
which we are regularly fixed, owing to the strong north wind, which
blows the spray like drizzling rain. Thermometer, before sunrise
23°; noon 28°; now, at two o’clock, 25°. At four o’clock we leave
this promontory, the wind having died away, and go N.N.E. and N. At
a quarter before five the wind gets up afresh; we go N.W. to the
right shore, where we shall remain perhaps the night. Thermometer,
at four o’clock 25°, sunset 24°, at eight o’clock 22°.</p>

<p><em>18th February.</em> Yesterday evening lightning, which
seemed to proceed from distant regions. We might perhaps have heard
the thunder, had not the everlasting noise, which, day and night,
stuns us in the vessels, prevented us. The sky is quite clouded
over, yet the sun penetrates through. I had scarcely stood ten
minutes at the door of our cabin, before my clothes were quite
damp, although no mist had visibly fallen. We find here many of the
before-mentioned potato-like tubers, the foliage and tendrils being
like those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175_v2">[175]</span>
strawberries, but the leaf is not so rough. The tubers, which are
yet small, are level with the ground, like those I had seen before,
and I planted some specimens in sand. A quarter after six o’clock
we bore off to N.E. to the great vexation of the crew, who were
obliged to leave unslaughtered on the shore three beautiful oxen;
then with a short bend to S.E. by W. and immediately W.N.W. On the
left a pastoral village with lowing cattle, and before us a forest,
veiled by a blue vapour, moves from the right side into the
monotonous landscape. In the bend again to N.E. and N.N.E., where
on the left is a pastoral village, but without herds.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine when the natives drive their cattle in and out;
for I have at all times of the day seen the beasts tied up in the
open air, near the villages, and I have never noticed any fodder.
Our presence and their curiosity makes them, perhaps, careless in
attending to them.</p>

<p>Half-past seven o’clock. N.N.W., and with a short course to
E.N.E, where, on the left, a pastoral village lies behind the
shore; then we turn sharply to N.W., where, on the left, another
pastoral village appears; at this we wind to N.N.W. We have a
gentle south-east wind, and are afraid of rain.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock. From N.N.W. to N.W., by N. Some tokuls, with more
elevated tops, shew themselves on the right side, where the river
immediately goes to the right; and at the same moment a row of
tokuls of similar construction is discovered on the left,
stretching in a falcated form along the shore. The old tokuls have
grooved roofs, reed-walls from which the clay has fallen, oval
doors, and some of them<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176_v2">[176]</span> with miserable reed-porches, and no
sleeping-places. A pastoral village follows, belonging, perhaps, to
this winter or women’s village. The Elliàbs inhabit both these
villages; but few of them shew themselves, and are called
<em>Wièn</em>.</p>

<p>Half-past eight o’clock. From N.N.W. to N.N.E., and N. by W.
Below, a large village opens before us, which the vessels a-head
leave to the left. The island, which is merely young grass,
floating on the river, only rises gently above the stream. A
quarter before nine o’clock. At some distance from the right shore
we see from the deck a large pastoral village. Nine o’clock. W.N.W.
The forest previously remarked has not approached nearer to us. A
quarter after nine, from S.S.W. to S.E., where the wind, for a
short space, is contrary to us; then, on the right, to S.S.W.; but
first we see two villages lying somewhat up the country on the
right side. We go E.N.E.</p>

<p>The south-east wind has freshened splendidly, and the log gives
five miles. The shores, although very low, are arid, and without
cultivation. Right and left are lakes, and near to the one on the
left a large village. Half-past nine o’clock; from E.N.E., a moment
to W.N.W.; on the point to the right, where the river bends N.W. by
W., an old tokul-village; on the left a lake, of half an hour long,
which is an ancient river-bed, as perhaps most of them are;
therefore the low shores divide them from us. A new forest before
us, to which we perhaps shall come. W. by N.: on the left a
wretched hamlet with mud-tokuls; but immediately afterwards a long
row of regular tokuls, whilst below a broad gohr enters
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177_v2">[177]</span> land about
N.N.W., which makes, therefore, these huts an island-city. The
people shout and bawl to us, as if we were old acquaintances: the
ambak-trees are used here for pallisadoes and screens. But few
people are seen, and these only old men and women. The island and
village are both called Aquàk, and this is the last possession of
the Bunduriàls. On the right shore the Tutuies follow, and the Keks
on the left. About ten o’clock we stop below this city of the
Bunduriàls. In the middle of the river a small island lies; level
low country, with narrow pools, and behind it the Haba lie opposite
to us, about half an hour distant. I despatch two servants to the
village, to make some purchases, but the women seize large pieces
of ambak-wood, and will not allow them to enter their harìm
city.</p>

<p>Half-past twelve o’clock, off again to N.E., and immediately on
the right to E., where the violent east wind throws us, for
amusement, on the left shore. One o’clock, N.W., then soon E.N.E.,
and a quarter before two, in the bend N.E. and N.N.W. From the
deck, we perceive two villages on both sides. Two o’clock, N. by
E., in the bend further to N.N.E.; on the left a pastoral village,
then to the left N.W. How it delights my heart to think that the
favourable south-east wind brings me every moment nearer to
Khartùm—to my brother! Half-past two, N. and N.W. by N.: a pastoral
village at the left; a quarter before three, N. by N.E., and round
the left to N.W. Three tokul villages in the country to the left.
Three o’clock, W.; on the left shore a pastoral village; before us,
in the distance, a forest. From the deck, I see behind the
last-named village<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_178_v2">[178]</span> another pastoral one. A quarter after
three o’clock, with a short bend to N.N.W., where a black tokul
village, behind the shadow of heavy clouds, looks like an old
castle with several pinnacles, until the latter disappear, and a
row of forty-five tokuls is formed. A small gohr enters below to
N.N.W., which, as seen from the deck, widens, and has a
tokul-village in its neighbourhood. Another little gohr to the
left, from N. to N.E., connected with the preceding one, leads
probably to a lake, for the left shore hardly rises above the
river. The right and blackened shore is also scarcely four feet
high. A quarter before four o’clock, from N.W., in a bend along
reeds standing in water, which, being slightly rustled by the
south-east wind, strike leaves and sprout, such as I have not seen
for a long time: to N. where a long shining road extends before us.
On the right two islets, verdant like the new-born low country of
the right shore; another larger island joins the second for a few
paces, and a fresh one is united to it close to the shore, which
appears here again to be scorched. On the left some other green
bushes of reeds are standing, and behind them, we perceive from the
deck a tokul-village. Four o’clock; from N.W. to W. by N.; on the
left a pastoral village, and then N.N.W. The forest, about an hour
distant from the left shore, where a pastoral hamlet stands,
stretches from S. to W. To my joy, young reeds extend from the
right corner, in a long bend with the river to N.E.</p>

<p>Half-past four o’clock, again in a long bend from N.E. to
N.N.E., N. and N.W to W.S.W., where we stop at five o’clock at the
right shore. A large lake lies at our side; behind it, another one
is incredibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179_v2">[179]</span>
enlivened by millions of birds, amongst which there are several
pelicans. I have never heard such a noise and fluttering of flying
birds, as I did here when on a shooting excursion. Thermometer,
before sunrise, 20°; noon, 27°; three o’clock, 29°; eight o’clock
in the evening, 24°.</p>

<p><em>19th February.</em>—We navigate, at seven o’clock, from N.
on the right, to N.E., and have soon to contend with a contrary
north wind. On the left we remark two of the narrow gohrs or
natural canals, serving, at high water, as channels to the lakes,
from which they are now disconnected. On the right, as yesterday at
noon, Tutuies; on the left, Kèks. A quarter before eight o’clock.
From N. to E. Here and there we see the negroes holding a stick,
covered with a skin of long hair, which appears to be a
battle-standard; they carry it always erect when they return from
war.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock. N.W. On the left a long tokul-village of the
Kèks, with ambak-hedges, instead of the solitary little court-yards
of the houses; the sleeping-places open above, and plastered below.
We no longer perceive magazines erected on stakes: the people here
never seem to think of the morrow. On all sides uncultivated soil,
and that has been the case for some time. Nature must provide the
necessary bread-corn and other fruits, without any exertion of men,
or the people must live principally on the produce of the chase,
and fishing.</p>

<p>Half-past eight o’clock. From N.W., with a short bend to S.E.,
yet only for a few paces; then again right round to N.N.W. We do
not remark that the water has fallen; it seems to be in its usual
shallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180_v2">[180]</span> state.
Young grass in the water at all the corners of the river or shores,
and also to the right of our bend. The marsh-regions, with their
noxious moisture and numerous glow-worms, are close to us.
Yesterday evening, the hollow sound of the drum foreboded their
approach.</p>

<p>Nine o’clock. To N.N.W. On the left a Haba, a quarter of an hour
distant. A quarter after nine o’clock. N.E.; and immediately we
double a flat green corner in the bend to S.W., and a very short
tract S., where there is a narrow pass. Half-past nine o’clock.
N.E. On the left a wretched hamlet, and a large lake in its
neighbourhood, with numerous birds, separated only a few paces from
us. Ten o’clock, N.; and to the left, round a green half-moon, to
W.S.W. Half-past ten o’clock. Again round a verdant margin of the
shore to the right, N.W. A quarter of an hour later we halt about
N.E.; and I accept Suliman Kashef’s invitation to dinner. To my joy
he talks a good deal of my brother. The Kèks have brought some more
teeth; but not one fell to my lot, in spite of all my endeavours.
About half-past one o’clock, we bear off again to N. and N.E. The
Elliàbs possess here also a tract, and likewise the Kèks; the
Tutuis dwell more up the country. Half-past one o’clock, W.S.W.;
then shortly S.W., and a quarter before two, to W., where the Haba
below seems to be close to the shore, and on the left side it is
scarcely half an hour distant; on the right a pastoral village.</p>

<p>Two o’clock, N.W. by W. On the right bank some men are employed
constructing a miserable pastoral village on old red ashes; behind
I see refreshing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181_v2">[181]</span>
green grass, but that on the shore is either dried up or burnt
away. A second pastoral village is being erected immediately on the
right; the commencement of it consists here of solitary
sleeping-places: stakes, and heaps of ashes are lying about in
large quantities. The pasture seems to be a dried-up marsh-lake, as
our landing-place in the middle of the day also was, where gazelles
and elephants were sporting in the high grass on the still moist
ground; but I could not even get a shot at the former. A quarter
after two o’clock. On the left withered ambak, and the neighbouring
forest seems to approach to the shore; on the right a pastoral
village, and a long tokul-village joining it, with and without
porches. Sale jumped to my window, and shouted “Kawagi! tali barre,
shuf uachet fill fok el bah’r”! (“Master, come out, and look at an
elephant on the shore!”) “<em>Kawagi</em>,” properly speaking,
being merchant, and the title for every Frank; “<em>fok el
bah’r</em>” means literally, over the river. And the whole crew
were all upon the move to see the elephant. I went up also on the
deck of our cabin, and perceived the dark-grey monster, throwing
first his trunk on the earth, and sending up clouds of dust, and
then lashing his body with it. A semicircle of negroes were
gradually approaching him, having spears in their hands; but they
fled from us, their best friends, when we landed. Suliman Kashef
soon opened a platoon fire, and I repaired immediately with Sale in
the direction of the elephant, who was looking around and preparing
to attack the crowd of people. The balls seldom whistled by him,
for the mark presented two large a volume to miss; and the
distance, short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182_v2">[182]</span>
as it was, was diminished to a few steps by the bloodthirsty circle
surrounding him.</p>

<p>He extended his ears up and down like the opening of an
umbrella, not so much from pain, as from the balls raining on them,
and sticking in the ear-laps, as we found afterwards, having only
penetrated one skin. He was already blinded by the shots, for in
elephant-hunts they first aim at the eyes, and few missed, or else
he would have made his way to the Nile by instinct, to preserve
himself for a time. Suliman Kashef knelt down and sent another
rifle-ball at his orbits; he fell—the men rushed at him, but he
rose once more, when they all started back, tumbling one over the
other to escape being trodden under his feet. At last he sat on his
hind-quarters, stretched forth his fore-feet, and died in this
half-standing posture. I could not have shot him myself so close,
for the blood running from his eyes and numerous wounds moved my
compassion too much to do so; even Sale said to me, in a melancholy
tone, “El messkin!” (the poor creature). I ordered him to cut off
the animal’s tail; for the Kèks, to whom Suliman Kashef had
presented the flesh, as a set-off for the beautiful teeth, had
already buried their knives in his body. Sale hesitated a moment,
because the awful sight of the beast made him fear that it might
possibly stand up again. Seven spear-heads were found in the flesh
under his skin, and he had swam over with these sticking in him,
from the opposite shore, where he was first hunted. I had already
embarked, when it struck me that the foot of an elephant was
considered a dainty, and I sent, therefore, a servant to fetch me
one; but he brought instead a large piece of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_183_v2">[183]</span> the ear, as a proof that he had
really gone back, for the people of this country seem to know what
is good as well as the Europeans at the Cape of Good Hope. Our
black soldiers, however, had brought flesh on board, which I
afterwards tasted, but did not find very relishing.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>A quarter after five o’clock we leave the spot, and navigate to
N.W. by N. On the right a small encampment for cowherds; on the
left burning reed-straw. The leaves of the elephant-tree, which I
had placed in my window, have withered since the morning, though
from the 6th instant, therefore for thirteen days, they had been
exposed to the sun and air, and had not only remained fresh and
green, but also seemed to shoot forth vigorously, and even to grow,
whilst the fruits became every day more and more shrivelled. The
juice of the latter might, perhaps, have nourished the leaves by
returning to them; the stalk between the wood and the leaves being
injured by the wind blowing it against a nail, shewed plainly that
it had lost its sucker. A quarter before six o’clock, N.
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184_v2">[184]</span> W.; close to
the left a large lake; on the right a reed fire. We wheel here on
the left to the W.; the surface of the earth is very low on the
right and left; the lakes, therefore, are not all dry, but
considerable rain must fall to make them overflow, unless they have
auxiliary canals from the river. A tokul-village before us to the
W., near which we shall perhaps stop, in consequence of the
horizontal smoke, and the smell of the meat connected therewith. A
floating island is at our side; the elephant may have torn it from
the shore in crossing. Six o’clock, W.S.W.; we ride at anchor in
the middle of the river, and have the village at our right.
Thermometer, before sunrise, 19°; noon, 27°; one o’clock, 28°; two
o’clock 30″; eight o’clock in the evening, 25°.</p>

<p><em>20th February.</em>—At 8 o’clock we navigate N.W.N. then
N.N.W. A quarter after eight o’clock. N.W. by W. We sail with a
faint north-east wind: to the right a pastoral village, to the left
the Haba, nearly a quarter of an hour distant; the shores low; then
N.W. by N., and again in the bend on the green margin of reeds to
N., and on the left to W.N.W. Nine o’clock. We stop at the left
shore, for the strong north-east wind is contrary to us in our
course from N. to N.N.E. Five o’clock. The whole day I have been in
bed, for I became so ill this morning, shortly after our departure,
that I could not sit upright, and therefore I wished very much for
wind and rest.</p>

<p>It is difficult to bargain with the blacks: they take the glass
beads, and the barter seems closed; but they immediately seize the
goods which they have already given us, and require more
sug-sug.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185_v2">[185]</span> The
following circumstance happened to me, when I was a short distance
from the vessel with one of my servants. I had bought a large
elephant’s tooth, and a chief refused not only to return the beads,
but even tried, with his men, to take away the tooth from my lusty
cook, Sale Mohammed, by force, and to sell it again; whereupon I
got angry, and struck him on the face with the flat part of my
hand: he stood as if petrified, but afterwards went away without
laying a hand on me.</p>

<p>Although the wind is still contrary, we navigate, immediately
after five o’clock, with libàhn, to N.N.E. by the right shore. The
real cause of our departure arose from Thibaut having gone ahead,
to purchase ivory, which the Turks will not permit. We work to N.
till a quarter before six, and in a bend to W., where on the right
is a smoking pastoral village, with several small plastered summer
tokuls. We sail delightfully from N.W., to N.N.W., the wind being
favourable. A short tract to the left S.S.E. and then immediately
to the right, N.N.W. We see again vessels surrounded by reeds,
where we could not have supposed them to be. The river here seems
to take delight in tedious and disagreeable bends. We halt after
sunset at the right low shore, where, at some distance, I perceive
an ambak thicket; but I am too weak to fetch seeds, and my men
immediately jumped ashore with gun in hand. Thermometer, at sunset
27°; noon 29° to 30°; sunset 27°.</p>

<p><em>21st February.</em>—Half-past seven o’clock. From N.W. to N.
and N.W. by N.: on the right a considerable pastoral village with
larger tokuls, and plastered sleeping-places; the latter slightly
diminishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186_v2">[186]</span>
towards the top. Saw men stand near these summer tokuls, the roof
of which rises only a little, and on the average, their heads are
of an equal height with the tops of their huts, and some even tower
above them. We stop at a quarter before eight o’clock between this
pastoral and the succeeding women’s village, where the river flows
northerly, and wait for cattle to be killed. The Kèks dwell on both
shores, and the Tutuis up the country on the right side, who live
at peace with the former.</p>

<p>The winter-tokuls, or women’s huts, appear from the river far
higher than they really are, for they mostly stand on the slightly
elevated margin of the shore. After repeatedly measuring them, I
find that they are from eight to eleven feet high, including the
lower walls, which are always from three to three feet and a half.
The roof is in from five to nine uniform grooves, for the straw is
not sufficient for the length of the roof. The small tokuls of the
pastoral villages are, on the average, from six to seven feet high,
including their walls, which are four feet, or something more;
those of the sleeping-places are as high as the reeds themselves,
namely, about ten feet. To the great diversion of the crew, a young
woman here also wanted to drive us to the right side, because our
vessel lay at anchor before her harìm.</p>

<p>I watched a friendly-looking woman making a <em>burma</em> (or
cooking apparatus), and putting the finishing stroke to it: she
rounded the outside of the earthen pot with water, and to get the
little hoops on it, she had a thick, strongly-twisted piece of
packthread, of a span in length, which she rolled over the smoothed
places. As far as I could learn from her,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_187_v2">[187]</span> these vessels are made merely by hand,
although it might be supposed, from the beautiful large vessels of
the Shilluks, that a potter’s wheel was used. The people here
display as little friendly feeling towards us as those yesterday. I
manage to get, however, a thick fluted hassaia of ebony, besides
some small elephants’ teeth.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock. At last a miserable cow was presented to us, and we
proceed W.N.W., a quarter of an hour later, S.W., although only for
a very short tract, and immediately N.N.W. We continue to have on
the left, green reeds in the water; and the shore on the right is
scarcely two feet high.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock. From N.W. to N.; in half an hour from S.E. and
N.E., with a short bend in W.N.W. to S.S.W.; then on the right a
short tract N.E. by N., and again N.N.W. The shores are scarcely
elevated above the river, and therefore numerous lakes must be
formed. I remarked, yesterday, crown-rushes (<i>papyrus
antiquorum</i>), which were still green, as well as ambak-thickets,
seeds of which plant I took this morning; its leaves were already
brown, and the tree itself in a dying state: there were not any
young shoots from the roots to be seen, nor from the seed that had
fallen in the preceding year; the latter lies therefore a year, and
perhaps till the next rainy season, in the ground, and then during
the time of high water, springs up with incredible vigour to that
height, which, upon this slightly elevated ground, was only twenty
feet; but in our ascent I remarked it double that height on a low
island in the river. Twelve o’clock. From N., to the left N.W. On
the right a pastoral village, and immediately right<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_188_v2">[188]</span> to N. in a bend. The river
is narrow, for the grass has grown into it.</p>

<p>“Baùda, baùda!” the crew screamed the day before yesterday,—a
dreadful word, in truth. Hitherto we have only seen a few of these
horrible mosquitoes, but in their stead a quantity of other
stinging insects. From N. immediately to the left, W.N.W. and a
short tract N.W. by N. The north wind has been long contrary to us,
but has not been particularly prejudicial to our voyage. Half-past
twelve—From N.W. to W.N.W. and W; for a moment N., and in a short
bend to S.S.W., where it winds to W. One o’clock.—About N.; a broad
arm of the Nile flows to W. We halt for a moment here by the
island. About S.E. by S., the mouth of another gohr going from E.
is seen; it discharges itself partly into the main stream to W.,
and partly flows to S.W., and forms another island. The careless
sailors have allowed the vessels to be thrown into this arm of the
Nile, and are now working to come to the W. into the main
river.</p>

<p>Half-past one. From W.N.W. left to S. Little ambak-woods on all
sides, but not having their fresh verdure; also crown-rushes, seeds
of which I have not yet been able to procure. A quarter before two.
From S. and S.W. to the right, shortly round to N.N.W. and on to
N.E. Two. From N.E. to the left round to N.N.W., then to the right
a few paces to N. A quarter after two. From N. and N. by E.: on the
right some negroes, who remain in a very quiet posture; to the left
W.N.W. Half-past two. W. by S., where we have a tolerably long road
before us, then W.S.W.; on the right a small summer village.
A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189_v2">[189]</span> quarter of an
hour later N.E. by E. and N., and so in a bend further to N.E.
Three o’clock. From N.N.E. to N.N.W.; the low shores or young
water-reeds and ambak thickets still continue. We see even now
several reed-fires, but the people appear, since our absence, to
have burned the reeds very well, for a quantity of green grass is
seen sprouting up from the scorched soil. On again in a long bend
to W.S.W.; on the right a pastoral village with little tokuls,
having roofs more pointed; on the left also a similar one; then at
four o’clock, opposite the bend in N.W. at a little distance, a
large lake, and behind it the Haba. The natives sing a little, but
remain quietly sitting. A quarter after four, from N.N.W. to the
left towards W., then with a short bend to the right N.N.E.; at
this sharp corner a small pastoral village, near which we halt at
the right shore. About south from our landing-place a large lake,
where the river winds from N. to N.N.W. on the left shore
immediately behind the green reeds. The natives have all fled
except one, who remains close to us; probably the fame of our love
for slaves has preceded us. Thermometer, before sunrise 20°; noon
and afternoon 28° to 30°; sunset 28°; eight o’clock 26°.</p>

<p><em>22nd February.</em>—We have waited since yesterday evening
in vain for Selim Capitan and Arnaud, who have struck into another
arm of the river. At nine o’clock this morning we see their mast at
a distance: they came up and we started at ten o’clock from hence,
where a large summer village is in the course of erection. We row
strenuously, for the north wind is contrary. From N. to. N.N.E.,
and at half-past ten to N. and N.N.E., and immediately to
W.N.W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190_v2">[190]</span> A quarter
before eleven E.N.E., and immediately N.N.W. Feïzulla Capitan had
epileptic attacks to-night again, perhaps arising from the tension
of the nerves of his fingers, for he has fabricated a tow-rope for
Suliman Kashef, and worked at it till late at night, as he has done
previously when engaged in sewing.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock. From N.N.W. to N.N.E.; an arm of the Nile flows
in on the right—the very same one navigated by Selim Capitan and
Arnaud. To the right a pastoral village on the head-land; we put
into land near it. Two o’clock; we leave the place, for the natives
will not approach us. From N.N.W. immediately to N.N.E., and a
quarter of an hour later with a short curve to N.W. The negroes
here wear only narrow ivory rings. From N.W. to N.N.W., and at
half-past two, from N. in N.E. by E., to E. by N. The shores are
either a green margin of grass, encroaching on the water, or if
they be dry, about two feet high, and behind them are
ambak-thickets, or crown-rushes, striking leaves, or dying away,
according as they are in low or high ground. Three o’clock; further
on in the bend to W.S.W., and again round the right to W. and N.W.
by W. There is not a man, house, hut, or cattle in these marshy
regions, from which I myself shall only be too glad to escape. A
quarter after three o’clock, N.N.W.; to the right a pastoral
village: we really see human beings, but they appear very listless,
and even the women remain quietly standing amongst them. Opposite,
another village; also negroes, but no herds. Half-past three, N.;
on the right a pastoral village. We proceed slowly N. by S.,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191_v2">[191]</span> N. by W.,
yet generally N.; and a quarter before four, N.N.E. Here and there
still there are floating islands; with a short bend N.W., and N.W.
by W. to W.N.W. On the right a lake; and at four o’clock in a
gentle bend to N.N.W., then round a corner, N.N.E., and E. by S.
but immediately again W.N.W. to S. by W. Half-past four, W.S.W; on
the right a pastoral village smoking vigorously, yet we do not see
any herds. A quarter before five, from S. by W., shortly round
N.N.W. to N., and to the left in N.W. At five o’clock again to the
right, N.N.W.; on the left hand a pastoral village, from N.E.,
immediately N.N.E., N., and N.W.; in a bend further on to S.S.W.
Half-past five, from S.S.W. in W., W.S.W., where a small pastoral
village appears on the right, to N.W.</p>

<p>For some days we have been without fowls and sheep on our
vessels, and we shall not, perhaps, procure any meat till we arrive
at the so-called, “Cannon place,” where the eighteen Nubas of
Darfur sought their way to freedom with only six guns. A quarter
before six o’clock from N.W., shortly round to W., and in a bend to
S. and S.E. by S. Six, S., and immediately in W.N.W to N., from
whence we navigate to the left round a corner. After six o’clock,
in a bend to S., and here again round a neck of land immediately to
N. Some trees, harbingers of a finer country, have shewn themselves
just now. A large lake secluded by palings, and perhaps, therefore,
subsequently furnishing the natives with fish, is noticed at about
fifty paces up the right shore. Here we make for land. Thermometer,
before sunrise 17°, noon 29 to 30°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192_v2">[192]</span><em>23rd
February.</em>—We navigated this morning to the left shore, whereon
there is a scanty Haba, in order to fetch wood and make
observations. I walked to the neighbouring Haba, where I saw men in
nine fishing-boats, catching fish. The lake is from forty to fifty
paces in the low ground, where it stands on an equal level with the
Nile, and enclosed with ambak hedges, from W. to S.E. It is a
remnant of the primitive bed of the stream, perhaps itself a
river-bed lately deserted, and surrounded on one side by the old
shores of the Haba, which are here only five to six feet above the
water, and form also the ancient left shore. From what I could see,
it is about three to three and a half hours’ long, by two hundred
to three hundred paces broad. It seems to derive its water from the
river, and to fill with the latter, but also to supply a mass of
water to it in the rainy season. It winds to S.S.E. and appears to
go still further eastward.</p>

<p>The Kèks live here very comfortably, merely on the fish they
catch; but with the exception of that, they are very poor. Yet they
came as proudly to us with two goats as if they had brought twenty
fat oxen. They do not seem to possess cows at all, and they may be
perhaps the Icthyophagi of the enclosed lake. However, we got seven
elephants’ teeth, the value of which they apparently did not know,
by the assistance of our interpreter. The Kèk women let the hair
grow a little: the lines on their forehead extend to behind their
ears; but they are fine, and frequently invisible on account of the
dirt.</p>

<p>Front and back aprons, as usual; at times, however, we see the
little rahàt, or even the leathern apron over the rahàt, clearly a
luxury, which the wife of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_193_v2">[193]</span> Làkono also indulged in. Besides this,
these women have a very <em>charming</em> appearance owing to their
chewing tobacco. There is another couple of poor villages in the
neighbourhood of this place, and the men are said to have fled from
it, taking their oxen with them. A quarter before five o’clock we
navigate at last to the north: the Haba retreats immediately to a
distance. On the right a little pastoral village, from whence we
receive the two goats mentioned above. A quarter after five, to the
left, N.W. by W., where there is a Haba; soon afterwards to the
right N.N.W. The higher shores have disappeared with the Haba. The
whole surface is scarcely two feet above the river. On the right
young reeds and reed-grass.</p>

<p>At this moment our vessel received from below a tremendous
shock: the crew cry “Chamùss, chamàss!” and laugh; but they very
soon put on a serious countenance, for the bottom of the vessel was
already full of water. The barrels of gunpowder, grape-shot, and
cartridge-boxes were taken out, five signals of distress having
been first fired; and they were about to continue firing blank
shot, for the water rushed in as if a leak were sprung, when the
bold reïs Abdullah, a Kenùss (the reïs are generally all Kenùss,
because they are well acquainted with the cataracts), went under
the vessel with a ball of tow: this took place close to the shore,
to which we were not able to approach within ten paces, and where
there was still great depth and danger. The hole, however, was
stopped by the brave and incessant exertions of some sailors and
soldiers. I myself put out the fire on the hearth, and forbad
smoking under the threat of instantly shooting any one who did so;
for I was to act,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_194_v2">[194]</span> in the absence of Feïzulla Capitan, as
wokil: and at the same time I posted sentinels. The vessels sailing
a-head did not stop at the signals we fired, although they were
near enough to hear them; and we ourselves, then, at half-past six
o’clock, navigated to N.N.W. Subsequently we go to the left,
W.S.W., then to the right, where we halt, together with the other
vessels, immediately in the bend at the left shore, at a former
landing-place (matrag betal mutfa), after we had jostled our
beak-heads together in the usual unskilful manner.</p>

<p><em>24th February.</em>—Our vessel has a large hole, and we are
obliged to be drawn by the prow upon the sand: all the goods were
removed, but afterwards safely put on board. Sabatier makes the
observations now, and Arnaud is said to be employed with the
calculations, for which, therefore, we shall have to wait a long
time. Several ostriches were seen yesterday by my servants and
Suliman Kashef’s body-guard, without a single well-flavoured leg
falling to our lot: they had remarked, also, an ape the size of a
large dog. I asked whether it was a chirt, which species answers to
our zoological ideas of the cynocephalus and cercopithecus; but
they assured me that it was an abelènk, because it had a small
head.</p>

<p><em>25th February.</em>—A quarter before seven o’clock, to
N.N.E., and slowly, N.E. by E. The thermometer, since three in the
morning, at sunrise, has been but 17°; and did not rise from noon
to three o’clock, above 29°. In the evening we see the sun
disappearing in the dense atmosphere, which lies heavily on the
whole of this country; and this morning it rose either from behind
the mist, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195_v2">[195]</span>
covered with clouds. The evaporation from the neighbouring stagnant
waters has an injurious effect upon the health of the crew, and
consequently they are nearly all afflicted with a violent cough.
The difference between this region and the clear mountain air and
pure water of Bari is very great. The fogs here are seldom so thick
as in Germany or England: but they penetrate through the skin,
which has become sensitive from the heat, as, for example, this
morning.</p>

<p>Seven o’clock.—N.N.W. On the left hand a large lake, close to
us, in the green reeds, connected perhaps with the river, and
indisputably an ancient bed of the river, cutting off the corner to
the left, which we shall hereafter double. Half-past seven o’clock.
N.W. We go till half-past eight o’clock in a northerly direction,
and halt in N.N.W. at the scorched right shore. This is here six
feet high, whilst, a hundred paces up the Nile, behind the young
water-reeds, no elevation of the shores is observed. We remark no
strata of earth on our shore, but clay and humus are closely mixed.
At nine o’clock we navigate further, without the lust of our crew
for meat being gratified, for the people seem to have driven away
their goats, and they have nothing else. N.N.E. The north-east wind
slightly retards our course. Half-past nine o’clock in a bend round
the green couch-grass, N.N.W.; a short tract N.W. by W., and round
the right to N.E., rowing strenuously; then, at a quarter before
ten, to N.N.E. The wind becomes stronger, and all the singing in
the world will not help us, if the river do not take a contrary
direction, of which there is some appearance.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_196_v2">[196]</span> Ten o’clock. N.N.W. We sail five
miles. N.W. and W.N.W. A quarter after ten o’clock from W.N.W. in
N. by W., where we were obliged, unfortunately, to furl the sails.
Immediately beyond N. to N.N.E. Half past ten, N.N.W.; a quarter of
an hour afterwards W., and round a short, verdant grass corner,
from E.N.E. to E.S.E.</p>

<p>The ants are of the greatest service here, for they throw up the
hills, which serve the people as watch-towers, from which they look
for their strayed friends and cattle. Half-past eleven o’clock. W.,
and immediately, in a short tract, to N.N.E., and also to N.N.W.,
and directly again to the right—slowly, owing to the contrary wind.
At twelve, N.E. by E. and E., where we halt at the right shore of
the reeds, to wait for Selim Capitan. Two o’clock.—Set off to
S.S.E. My men bring me three short-haired sheep in the sandal—a
thing now seldom met with—and a motley, decorated gourd-shell. A
quarter after two. From E. to the left, a short way to N.N.W., and
again to the right N.N.E.; also, at half-past two, a few paces to
N. by W. and N.N.E. Immediately round a sharp grass-corner S.S.E.;
then, a quarter before three, in the bend beyond E. and N. to N.W.
by W.; on the right, up the country, a large village, and W.S.W.;
again a village in the neighbourhood. The river winds to the right,
W. We have hoisted already our fore and after-sail, as if we had to
go again N.E. with a contrary wind. In the bend to N.N.W., on the
right, a village upon a little hill, which I sketched; then N.
Half-past three. At the right a gohr, going to E., and then S. N.W.
We halt immediately at the right shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197_v2">[197]</span><em>26th
February.</em>—Departure at half-past eight o’clock, N.N.W. My
three sheep, which were in the meadow on the shore, ran away whilst
my men were cutting reeds, from which Venetian blinds are said to
be made in Khartùm. We sail with a south-west wind, and make five
miles. A quarter before nine o’clock, from N.W. to N.N.W. and
W.N.W.; again to N.W. Nine o’clock N., a small tract to N.E., and
in the bend shortly to N., when the sails are reefed. Half-past
nine.—From W.S.W., for a short time in W.N.W. and N.; some large
hippopotami shew themselves, and we begin now to fear for the
vessel. We sail with five miles’ rapidity. A quarter before ten
o’clock, N.N.E. Some negroes have just come to the left
shore,—ashes their ornaments, ashes their clothing. Ten
o’clock.—For a moment to S.W. by W., and shortly round the green
corner of the right shore to N.N.W. This winding costs some
trouble, for the wind blows the vessel right round. Half-past ten,
W.N.W.—Ambak being still green as it nearly always is in this
Holland kind of country, covers all the right side at a slight
distance from the shore: in a little bend to N.N.W., then round an
obtuse corner, W. by S. A quarter before eleven W., and in a wide
bend to E. Eleven. Likewise from E. to N.W., then W.N.W. The shores
are generally elevated only two feet above the water, wherein a
grass margin intrudes; behind, every thing is burnt away, and
therefore the ambaks are withered, unless they stand in a
protecting marsh. A quarter before twelve.—N.W. on the left hand, a
large and long-scattered village on a high tract, and a little
upwards a considerable lake, with a similar village,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_198_v2">[198]</span> connected with the Nile by
a ditch. Natives squat on the shore and hold up their hands. Twelve
o’clock. To N. A quarter after twelve from N. by E., in a bend N.W.
The lakes, which I generally take to be old beds of the river,
retaining water even in the dry season, are a proof that the
primitive stream has gone far deeper, and that even the present bed
of the river, with which they are partly connected, must have risen
as well as the whole country; because, had it been otherwise, they
would have ebbed away. Half past twelve.—From N.W. to N., N.N.E.
and E. One o’clock.—S.E. in an arch to N., and round a little
corner to N.W.; on the right a tokul-village. Half-past one o’clock
N., and a quarter before two N.N.E., then on the left to W.S.W.,
and on the right to N.N.W. and N. by E.; at two o’clock further to
N.N.E. and N.E. by E. A quarter after two, N.W. by N.; on the right
a broad river arm coming from S.S.E. From the mast they tell me
that it is a gohr cul-de-sac, and therefore an ancient bed of the
stream filled up from below. We halt at the right shore, for Arnaud
wants to survey it; but he lies down to sleep, and we bear off
again without having effected our object. At a quarter after three,
N.N.W., and directly round the right, E.N.E.; to the left a little
W., and then N.N.W. and N.N.E. Four o’clock.—Again N.N.W. and
W.S.W. The wind ceased even at noon; it had been of little service
to us. The floating islands of creepers are still the order of the
day; but not so large and numerous as in our ascent.</p>

<p>A quarter after four, W.N.W., in a flat arch to N. by W. The
north wind having now set in delays us<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_199_v2">[199]</span> exceedingly. Five o’clock, N.N.E., a
long road before us. We go at six o’clock to the right shore, where
the river winds N.N.W. I go upon deck, but feel so enervated by
continually sitting, that I do not venture into the half-burnt high
grass on the shore, where our sentinels, as usual, have their posts
on the ant-hills, as a measure of precaution against the desertion
of the soldiers, as well as any sudden attack of the natives.
Thermometer at sunrise, 17°; noon, 29°; without getting up any
higher.</p>

<p><em>27th February.</em>—At half-past seven we set ourselves in
motion to N.N.W., and soon N.W. Not a negro is to be seen here: the
country appears, even at a distance, to have no population or
settlement. Perhaps Nature thinks fit to give a long preparation to
these regions, in order to elevate the alluvial deposits for the
habitation of man, and to form the stream territory, and thus to
realise the principles of humidity; or all this land is subject to
a deluge, and tracts, which are now deserts, have become dry. Truly
it might be the work of thousands of years to dry up an inland sea,
such as that between the mountain terrace of Fàzogl, and the
mountains of Kordofàn, towards the sources of the White Stream,—to
extend it, with unknown ramifications, through the mountains of
Bari to Habesch and Darfur, or Fertit, &amp;c., and at last to
break down at the Nile valley, near Khartùm, those barriers which
display themselves there in solitary rocky hills and mountains.
Eight o’clock, from N.W. by N. with a fair south-westerly wind to
W. A quarter after eight, W.N.W.; the wind freshens, and we make
six miles. Half-past eight, in a bend to N., and further to S.E.
A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200_v2">[200]</span> quarter before
nine o’clock to N.W., and on to N.N.W.: on the right an isolated
dhellèb in the reeds. Nine o’clock, in a flat arch again to N. by
E.: on the right a village, with extremely low tokuls. On the left
we remark another elephant-tree, and at a quarter of an hour
distant, on the right, a forest. A quarter after nine o’clock.—N.
by W. and E.: on the right a lake, with a village, at a short
distance from the shore. The lake cuts off, near the Haba, that
large angle formed by the river, and belonging therefore to the
primitive bed. The poison-trees make me recognise that scanty
forest where we landed previously. With a sharp turn from E. over
N. to W. by S., and immediately at half-past nine o’clock, W.N.W.,
and further round an arch of reeds in narrow water to E.N.E., where
we stumble again upon the Haba. A quarter before ten, we double a
corner N.W. by N., and in a flat arch to W.; seven miles.</p>

<p>We land at the right shore near the solitary stunted trunks of
trees, which belong to a former forest. In the neighbourhood a
large lake. A little after ten, again from thence, N. by W., N. by
E. to N.E. A quarter after ten, to N., and then E. by N. Some
fishermen’s tokuls to the left on the low shore: neither men nor
periàguas to be seen, the former having probably fled. A quarter
before eleven o’clock, from E. to N.N.W. Eleven o’clock, to N. and
N.N.E. Unfortunately the wind has slightly slackened, yet we still
make four miles. A quarter after eleven, E., then to N. Half-past
eleven, N.W.; further W., when our sailing ends for some time, to
W.S.W. A quarter before twelve, from W.S.W. to N.W., when we sail
again, and N. to N.E. by E.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_201_v2">[201]</span> On the left, some negroes in the reeds,
who speak to us, but we do not understand them. N.N.E., and
immediately N. by E., and E. by S.; on the left a miserable
fishing-hamlet.</p>

<p>Twelve o’clock.—Round the left, in the bend, N., and further to
W.N.W., where a long water-tract lies before us. Half-past twelve:
N.W. from S., a broad gohr comes on the left of us, by which the
river is considerably widened. To N. and N.E., then N. by E.; and a
quarter before one o’clock, to the right, E.N.E., and directly to
the left, in the bend, N. and N.W. Half-past one, N.N.E. to E. then
N. by E. to N.W. by W. A quarter after two, N.N.W., and N. to W. by
N., and again to N.N.W., and N.W. by N. Half-past two, N.N.E., and
with a short turn, a quarter before three, to W., and on to W.S.W.
On the left a large lake; then N.W. and N., and in the bend, to
S.E. by E.; gradually again to E.N.E. Half-past three, N.N.W.,
where we stop at the scorched right shore. Subsequently we go to
the left, where the reeds are protected a little from the wind.
Wonderful to relate, I got in such a perspiration by bathing in the
Nile, although at first I could not move after it, that I was
obliged to fly away from the cold wind to the cabin, and even there
to wrap myself up in the barakàn (Herahn) folded four times
thick.</p>

<p><em>28th February.</em>—At a quarter before eight, we navigate
from N.N.W. to N. On the right, several solitary large tokuls are
to be seen from the deck, and then N.N.W. Sale brought a crane of
gigantic size; but he had kept our vessel waiting for him half an
hour, although only this morning I had enjoined<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_202_v2">[202]</span> him to be attentive to the
roll of the drum, and the sails. To awaken his sense of discipline,
and as a warning for the negligent soldiers, I got Feïzulla Capitan
to give him some stripes over the hand, sparing him by this means
the disgrace of receiving this slight punishment from a subordinate
officer.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock.—N.W. A quarter of an hour later, from N.N.W. to
W.N.W. It blows a gentle south-west wind; but we are obliged still
to make use of the oars. Half-past eight o’clock.—From W.N.W., to
N.N.W. and E. The air is thick, like yesterday; a heavy dew falls,
and neither sunrise nor sunset is perceived. A quarter after nine
o’clock.—From E., round the left, to W.N.W., where a large
scattered tokul-village lies on the right, and behind it a lake.
The Nuèhrs dwell here, and some of them come to Selim Capitan, when
he halts at the right shore, which they did not do on our ascent.
We proceed in a flat arch to N.E. The wind has freshened a little,
and the oars rest; we make five miles. A quarter before ten
o’clock, from N.N.E. to W. Ten o’clock, with a short turn, to
N.N.E. A quarter after ten, in a small bend, to W.S.W., where we
are obliged, unfortunately, to furl the sails, to S. by E. A
quarter before eleven.—Shortly round to S.W. and S.S.W. Eleven.—To
the right; very shortly round to W.N.W., and the sails spread, to
the joy of all who wish to push forward and see their friends; but
directly again to the left, S.; on the right, hamlets, with men. A
quarter after eleven. At the left a small lake in the river, formed
by other tributaries. We go W.N.W., and land at the left shore.</p>

<p><span class="sc">1st March</span>.—The Nuèhrs are afraid of us,
on the whole, yet they brought us, yesterday, one of their
bracelets. We shall remain here to-day till the afternoon; for,
although we arrived yesterday before mid-day, yet nothing has been
done by the gentlemen engineers, and every minute appears to me
lost that we are on shore, for there is no village there. I made a
short shooting excursion this morning with Sale, and shot two
<em>karawans</em>. I approached the side where the little bay is
formed in the river, in order to examine it closer. I arrived
through burnt reeds at<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204_v2">[204]</span> an ambak-thicket, and came here upon
thick half-burnt reeds, whilst the ground was very swampy; and then
I pursued a bird unknown to me, close to the margin of a small
lake, bordered by ambaks. I ought to be thankful that I was able to
find the right road with my black feet over stalks of reeds which
were trodden down, and to get out at last from the dangerous
path.</p>

<p>Nuèhrs are scattered on all sides; but the men did not venture
near the vessels. The women, on the contrary, were excessively
talkative. They <em>would</em> see the vessels, and it was with
them we transacted business and bargained for durra and tobacco.
They have shaven heads, and the young women, notwithstanding this
disadvantage, do not appear ugly. They have a very small hole bored
through the flesh, between the nose and upper lip, in which we
remark a thin blade of straw, or a small stick, to prevent it
closing; or they put in it a needle, ornamented with a glass bead,
extending slightly beyond the end of the nose: kissing, therefore,
must be very difficult, if it happen to be the custom here. The
whole rim of the ear is also pierced through, and from want of
glass beads or other ornament, we perceive a little piece of wood
in it. There are no lines on their forehead; front and back leather
aprons are slung round the hips, or simply a rahàt, made of the
narrow slips of dome-palm leaves. Here and there an ivory necklace,
or strips of bark are seen, and around the neck a few miserable
glass beads: these are the only ornaments which the poor women
possess. Although I gave them some glass beads, at their humble
request, yet their modesty was so excessive, that not one of
them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205_v2">[205]</span> would sell
me her rahàt. They carry the small baskets, containing durra and
tobacco, on their heads, with considerable dexterity, as is common
on the White River. The women, in these countries, have no voice in
the public assemblies, and therefore they make up for it by talking
whenever they get the opportunity—a natural wish for
emancipation!</p>

<p>The men here and there have interesting physiognomies, and which
are particularly improved by the hair being worn in a natural
manner: it is mostly one and a half to two spans long, but
sometimes cut short. Their red colour—which is here of a fiery
red—seems to be the favourite national colour. Our men thought it
was natural; but I discovered, from many of these men, that they
stain themselves artificially. At first, I believed that they wore
a coiffure, similar to a wig; but I soon found that they had tied
up the long hair behind into a thick tuft, and plastered over the
whole head with a strong coating of ashes and an alloy of clay,
which has the same effect as the <em>hennah</em> of the Turkish old
women, who prefer to have red rather than grey hair. We laugh at
seeing these stiff and dirty perukes, and yet our periwig-mania has
only of late years been defunct; whilst, even now, the
highly-civilized English still wear the full-bottomed wigs, and
seem to think that a quantity of powder, long, stiff body-coats,
and loose gaiters, are essential for their young servants. We
perceive, upon the very projecting forehead of the Nuèhrs, six
horizontal lines, more or less elevated: they wear well-worked
bracelets, narrow, but thick, with a sharp edge, the best of which
I bought, and amongst them a thin one, adapted to the form of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206_v2">[206]</span> upper part
of the arm, above the elbow. They have, besides, very frequently,
iron rings on the wrist, and a species of battle-ring, having
several tongues, similar to those I saw above, and the points of
which are covered with little pieces of wood in time of peace. They
adorn their ears with a bead, or a red copper ring, like the
natives of the country below Bari. The <em>aures perforatæ</em> are
not, therefore, here a sign of slavery, as with most other people.
I saw no weapons, except their artfully-constructed bows; for they
told us previously that they would not bring any arms to the
vessels, so that there might not be schammata (strife). I was
present when the Sheikh of the right side of the shore, who had
brought some cows, was clothed by Selim Capitan. He expressed great
joy when the beads were shewn him, but he would not have anything
to do with the white or the black maccaroni, although there were
gold ones between them. He said “arràd” (bad), and returned
them.</p>

<p>His name was Lunjòk, and his village lies at a distance from the
shore. His father is a sheikh on the left shore, but the
inhabitants of both sides, although they are all Nuèhrs, are
continually at war with one another, which he seemed to deplore.
They must possess arms, because they make war against the Shilluks
and the Kèks, and are generally successful, although they do not
boast of it. Most of their villages lie on lakes or gohrs up the
country. We saw here also three hamlets lying in ruins, on which I
walked, and where even the reeds were torn away. I plainly saw that
the place where these villages stood must have been heightened by
the destroyed mud-walls.</p>

<p>The men wear small white beads round their necks,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_207_v2">[207]</span> which are said to come from
Pamm, in the country of the Dinkas: they do not themselves
slaughter any cattle, as we were told, but eat animals slain by
others, or those that die a natural death. They have not a supreme
master, or Sultan.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, we remarked a large circle of fires and
solitary dhellèbs around us, denoting that the villages of the
Nuèhrs were near at hand. I got to-day a curious head-dress, of
leather and goats’ tails; we see here also those mussels (<i>Cypræa
moneta</i>), which I have mentioned before, used as an ornament. We
have never observed knives since we left Làkono’s country: spears
seem to be used instead of them, and therefore we found them
frequently worn away and useless, and not fastened by a nail to the
shaft. Our black soldiers make use of the spears they have
purchased, instead of knives; and, moreover, the Nubian two-edged
knife, and that of Kordofàn, still retain the form of a spear. The
bull, as the creator and support of the herds, must be honoured and
esteemed here, for the rings worn by the tribes on the wrists, from
hence to Berri, are everywhere decorated with little iron horns,
and the natives imitate immediately the lowing of cattle, when we
look at the rings.</p>

<p>A very <em>charming</em> custom of these tribes came to light
during our barter with them. My servant Fadl had purchased
articles, as he had often done before, and given some in exchange,
when subsequently they demanded that the rings should be returned,
which he would not consent to. A negro tore the flesh of his arm
with a spear, so that the blood spurted out; but no sooner did he
see this, than he spat upon the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_208_v2">[208]</span> injured place, and begged pardon by
gestures. The spitting in the hand is not perhaps meant, in the
upper countries, as a mode of greeting or particular distinction,
but rather as a kind of apology, or to exorcise the spirit of
anger.</p>

<p>Suliman Kashef was even fortunate enough to receive such a
secretion on his head, as a sign of respect, which made him put on
a grim countenance. The people seem generally to make use of this
spitting custom for the purpose of exorcising evil spirits: we find
something analogous to this in the so-called “evil eye” of the
South of Europe, namely, of Italy and Greece. Our deserters, we
learn, passed here only yesterday; the Nuèhrs would have robbed
them, as the women told the little Dinkaui in my presence; but the
latter shot some of the Nuèhrs (the women said <em>several</em>),
and then crossed to the right side of the river. The Nuèhrs
themselves had perhaps killed a few, but were frightened that we
should take revenge, and pretended therefore that they had treated
them peacefully. The poor men will have a great deal to suffer in
their journey to their distant home.</p>

<p>Half-past three o’clock.—We proceed to N. The gentle south-east
wind is at our back, so that it is very hot. Four o’clock.—A short
tract to N.E.; on the right a wretched hamlet, to N.W. and W.,
W.S.W.: green shore but low; ambaks, and some trees with thick
foliage at our left. A quarter after four o’clock, N.W. to N.E. by
N. Solitary elephant-trees, poison-trees, of larger height than we
had yet seen, àschurs, young dome-palms, and soon a Haba on the
left shore, which is elevated therefore higher than usual. Negroes
and women greet us in vain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_209_v2">[209]</span> from the left side. Half-past five
o’clock. N.E. by E., in a bend to N.W. and W.N.W.; then immediately
N. by E. Just after six o’clock, we come to N.E. by E., and go over
to the right shore. Thermometer, at sunrise, 28°; noon, 28°.
Half-past three o’clock, 31°; sun-set, 28°.</p>

<p><em>2nd March.</em>—A quarter before seven, to N. by W., then
N.W.; and at seven o’clock, N.E., E.N.E., and N.E. by E. I cannot
describe the agony we suffered from the gnats; my head is so heavy
that it has become quite a useless member of my body. A quarter
before eight, further to E.; and at eight o’clock, to the left, N.
On the right, in this bend, a village, the negroes standing on
their ant-watch-towers. The south-east wind is favourable; the
negroes sing the usual old melodies, but cease directly, when they
see the vessels sailing past, without noticing their song of
welcome. The wind freshens, and the sky becomes cloudy: it looks
like rain, and yesterday evening we perceived a storm in the
distance.</p>

<p>Our deck being in such bad condition, will afford us, in truth,
but little protection. Five miles. From N. in the bend to N.W.,
then right round at a quarter after eight to N., N.E. and E., where
we furl the sails, and immediately to E.S.E. Luckily this last
tract is not long, and the wind may soon help us out of these
abominable regions of mosquitoes. But unfortunately now, it is
contrary to us, and masters the oars so that we are obliged to go
libàhn, and land at half past eight at the left shore, for the
Kaiàss has remained behind. A little village is seen here, and now
goes on the pulling of rings off the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_210_v2">[210]</span> arms, so that the bones crack again, and
the natives even break them in two on the arm, merely to procure
sug-sug. I get here, besides other things, a bow, such as those
already described, a rahàt of palm-leaves, and a club with a knob,
almost the same as we have seen up to Bari.</p>

<p>The red copper earrings, which perhaps come from Berri, do not
seem to be of any particular value; for they take them out of their
ears when we ask for them. The men also, when they have no ivory,
wear strips of leather, or of bark, round their necks and arms,
such as are usual in all the regions of the White Nile.</p>

<p>The hair combed back, and not entirely reddish here, but
retaining its natural black colour, gives the head an European
look, and particularly so, because it is not woolly, although
curly. This remarkable circumstance speaks in favour of the
immigration of another race, as I have formerly alluded to. And
this supposition becomes still more confirmed when we observe the
greater neatness and durability of their tokuls, which are entirely
dissimilar to those in Sennaar; so also their household utensils,
and even the form of their bows and quivers, which are similar to
those seen on the hieroglyphics, shew that they are either in a
much higher grade of cultivation, or have outstripped considerably
in civilisation the neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p>A quarter before twelve o’clock. Further to N.N.E. and N.N.W. We
sail six miles in the hour, and shall escape, perhaps, the rain,
which has announced itself by some drops; but we are obliged to
reef the sails, owing to the other vessels being behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211_v2">[211]</span>A quarter
after twelve.—N.N.E. to N.E. by E., a short tract; then in a bend,
N. to W., and at last, with a short bend, to E. Half-past
twelve.—From E.N.E., in a wide bend, to W.N.W.; but immediately
again in a bend, N.N.W. We hoist again the sails. N., and on to
N.E.—E. by S.</p>

<p>Nothing but green aquatic-grass on the shore, and although the
singing, bawling, and shouting on the vessels gives life to the
scene, yet all at last turns to dull monotony. Illness and fatigue
make me wish to rest a little, but I keep up in order to attain the
aim I have in view. The wind has changed to south, perhaps for our
benefit. One o’clock.—From E. by S., where a dhellèb appears on the
right to N.N.E., E.N.E., and N.W. by N. Two o’clock.—E.N.E. to E.
Half-past two.—N. to N.W., on the right a little village behind the
reeds; further to S.W., and then with a short bend W. I see
blooming ambaks at the left, and shall be able perhaps to gather
again some of its flowers, and also the little duck-meat: the
double lotus is there, but I have already seeds and tubers of that
plant. The first group of dhellèb-palms is a welcome sight before
us, for hitherto we have only seen solitary ones. A quarter before
three, N.N.W. There are now thirteen dhellèb-palms at the most on
our left. On we go,—I think we shall return to these dhellèbs—to
E.N.E. and E.; a blooming ambak-thicket at our right. Three
o’clock. From E. shortly round to W.N.W. On the right we remark
negroes. The wind is certainly not so strong as previously, yet we
make five miles more. Now at the right a badly-built hamlet, which
contains tokuls with oval doors,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_212_v2">[212]</span> and depressed and badly formed roofs
plastered at the top with clay: soon afterwards, at the same side,
another hamlet in the very same style. Perhaps both these villages
contain summer tokuls, to judge from the miserable roofs of the
huts, which do not keep off the rain. A quarter after three. From
N.W. by W. to N. The wind has already slackened, but it appears
again to think better of it, or we should have to expect the
troublesome visit of gnats. Half-past three o’clock.—From N. by E.
to N. Four o’clock.—N.W. and further in a flat arch to W. by S.
Half-past four to five, W. to N. The sun sinks in a mist. At the
right shore, where the reeds are burnt away, we notice a giraffe
(saràff), and Suliman Kashef sends his halberdiers in pursuit of
it.</p>

<p><em>3rd March.</em>—We navigate a quarter after six o’clock from
the middle of the river, wherein we cast anchor last night to
N.N.W., then a little to N. and W., where a hamlet lies on the
right to W.N.W. A quarter before seven o’clock.—W.N.W.; a slight
S.E. wind gets up. Seven o’clock.—N.E. by E.,on the right some new
summer tokuls; to E. and a quarter of an hour afterwards to N.E. by
E. The oars rest, and we sail very slowly with the gentle wind, the
river having a trifling fall. A long course is before us and the
wind freshens immediately, so that we make four miles. On the left
a village at the distance. A quarter after eight.—N.N.E., N. and
N.N.W., a poor fishing village at the left. A quarter before nine,
to W.N.W., the wind still better; five miles. A quarter after nine,
to W.; on the left several large tokuls up the country; again to
W.N.W. and then N. by W. A narrow gohr comes on the left from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213_v2">[213]</span> reeds
S.S.W.; the whole marsh-region here is in endless connection with
the river, visibly and invisibly, by open canals and reeds. On the
right a hamlet. Half-past nine o’clock, N.W. Smoke or mist extends
before us, making the vessels a-head appear as if they were in an
extensive and elevated sea.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour ago we had six miles and now six miles and
a half. A row of solitary and very large tokuls continues on our
left. The villages, properly speaking, of the Nuèhrs, are half or
three quarters of an hour from the river. The smoke just mentioned
comes from the tokuls I have described, as the smell of burning
tells us. From N.W. to N.N.W. and N.; and at ten o’clock on to N.E.
and E.N.E. We leave a rush and grass island of about ten minutes
long in the middle of the river. A quarter after ten, N.E., N. and
N.W., and so quickly that it is quite delightful: we make seven
miles. Half-past ten o’clock.—We double half-dried ambaks, which
still display flowers. To N.N.W., N.E. by E., then shortly to N.W.
and N.W. by W. On the right some negroes standing by their boats:
they shout to us, but we wont hear. A quarter before eleven. From
N.W. to N.N.W., N. and N.N.E. we have a long course before us, with
slight declinations to N. by E. There are no elevations of the
shores either right or left; merely aquatic reeds: behind, here and
there, the surface of the earth is dry, and there are a few
ant-hills with parched grass or a reed-hut. Eleven o’clock.—With a
short bend N., we make eight miles: to N.W. and soon to N. On the
left some wretched reed-tokuls, and negroes, the women standing
upon a mound and singing. Further<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214_v2">[214]</span> to the right N.N.E. Half-past eleven.
Shortly to the left, round N.N.W. and W.N.W. then immediately to N.
and N.N.E.—A quarter before twelve o’clock, still N.N.E. and then
N.</p>

<p>The Turks have one magnanimous custom, despotic as they are in
other respects. If the master call and the servant answer boldly,
“I am eating,” he need not come; so if the former say, “Call me
such a one,” and his messenger comes back with the report that the
man he wants is asleep, the master lets him quietly take his siesta
whatever hour of the day it may be. Twelve o’clock.—N.N.E. and
immediately N.E., then N.N.W. and again N. A quarter after twelve
to N. by W. and N.W., when we turn to N.W. by N.; then we go in a
regular bend N.E. to N.E. by E. A quarter before one.—N.W. by N.,
and at one, to N.E. by N. We have just saved a Dellàhl (crier at
the sale of slaves and public auctions), the Abu Haschis of the
Kaïass, who jumped into the water to seize a large dead fish,
notwithstanding we were sailing quickly. With a few exceptions we
still continue to make eight miles. Nothing but aquatic reeds and
crown-rushes; very few high reeds, and these beyond the reach of
the water.</p>

<p>I will now repeat my journal word for word, in order to give the
reader an exact description of the labyrinths of the river. I have
hitherto partly avoided the detailed description of the windings,
so as not to be wearisome by constantly repeating the same thing;
and these, moreover, are shewn in the map which was composed on the
groundwork of my journal, and which accompanies this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215_v2">[215]</span>A quarter
after one.—From N. in a bend to the left, N.N.E., and then again
right round in an arch, where the south-east wind may be contrary
to us; N.E. with a short turn to E.N.E., and on to E.S.E. The sails
can work, for the wind graciously continues and blows in S.
Half-past one.—From E.S.E., shortly round the left to N.N.E. and
N.; we furl the sails in order to wait for the vessels behind. Two
o’clock.—In the bend S.E. and E., where a tolerable course displays
itself, and we again draw in the sails. A large hippopotamus snorts
at the side of the vessel, and no one laughs at it, for we have
learned to know already that the proximity of these ship-stormers
is dangerous. A quarter after two. To the left in the bend, E.N.E.;
we sweep by on the reeds like lightning, N.N.E. to N. by E., then
in a flat arch to the right, N.N.E., which bends still more to E.,
E.N.E., and S.E. We saw several black birds both yesterday and
to-day, called gatàff by the Arabs,—a species of water-hen, which
flew over the ships in swarms till late in the evening, and uttered
a piercing cry.</p>

<p>A quarter before three, from S.E., left to N. by E., and right,
N.N.E.; four miles, with a slack wind. Three o’clock, from N.N.E.,
shortly round the right; a small island at the left, with
reed-grass, crown-rushes, and blooming ambàks. To E., where a
tolerable road opens before us; then to the left, E.N.E. Course
three miles and a half; but the cloudy sky forbodes a squall, yet
it may blow off, as it has done on other days.</p>

<p>Half-past three; from E.N.E. to the left, in a bend N., and N.
by W.: a road before us, then to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_216_v2">[216]</span> right: make again five miles—in the
bend, N.N.W. A quarter before four, on and on slowly to the right,
N.E. On the right a large lake, which is connected with the river
by a wide mouth; several negroes standing there, but no tokuls to
be seen. Four o’clock, N.N.E., then to the left, with a small
declination to N. by E., and then to the right; three miles
rapidity—E.N.E.</p>

<p>Half-past four.—To the right E., and straightforward, with small
inlets, further to E. by N., five miles. The wind blows fresher.
Five o’clock, from E. to the left, shortly round N.N.E., to N. by
W. Half-past five.—From N. to the right N.N.E., still there are no
shores, no burnt tracts of land. A quarter before six.—From E.N.E.
to the left N.E., where we anchor in the middle of the river. A
little lake, Haba, and the isolated tree to the right.</p>

<p><em>4th March.</em>—Departure at half-past six o’clock, from
N.E. to N. by E. A quarter before seven, in a flat arch on the
right, to N.N.E. Hitherto, not any wind, and perhaps not much hope
that there will be, for the day is clearer than usual, although it
blows a little from the west. The west wind only brings rain now
and then to the land here. Seven o’clock, from E.N.E., round the
left N.W.; on the right the “Village of War,” so called by the
crew, on account of the cruelty exercised previously on the
natives, and which I have already related.</p>

<p>Half-past eight; from N.W., on the left two little islets follow
one another, to N.N.W. A quarter before nine; the vessels come
behind us, the south-west wind gets up a little, and we sail
therefore on to N.; three miles; N.E. by E. Selim Capitan
says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217_v2">[217]</span> we made
sixty-five miles yesterday, and thirty-five more to-day, in the
direction of the lake of the Bahr-el-Gasàll. Nine o’clock, from
N.N.E.; a little island in the bend, to the left N. and N.N.W.,
then in a flat arch to N.N.E. Half-past nine, N. by W.; the wind
freshens for five miles, N. and in the bend, on to N.N.W., where we
are unfortunately obliged to furl the sails, owing to the strong
north-west wind which has set in. A quarter before ten: we go N.W.;
the wind becomes fresher; it seems inclined to be contrary to us
the whole day, and we have enough to do to stand against it. A
quarter after ten; W., and slowly to N.W., then right round to N.,
where we spread sails, after the wind had changed magnificently to
the west, and perhaps will go again to S.W.—five miles. Eleven
o’clock; from N. by E., in a bend to N. by W., in a long bend
N.N.E., then shortly round the right. Half-past eleven, to S.E. by
E.; afterwards in the arch to E.N.E., with six miles, and on to
N.E. and N.N.E. Twelve o’clock; from N.N.E., a jump to the right,
N.E. by N., then in the bend to N., and again N. by E., and a
little to the left, N. One o’clock, N.N.E., and further to N.E.
Half-past one; to N.N.E., and again in a flat arch to N.E. and E.,
to E. by S. Two o’clock, E.N.E.</p>

<p>The neighbouring ambak bushes approach us in these windings, and
make the shores less monotonous; yet it does not last long, and we
see again only grass, water, and sky. Half-past two, N.E.; a
quarter before three, N.E. by E. We see from the deck a high
mountain to N.N.E. at the distance. It must be the so-called
Tickem, or the Morre, as Marian<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_218_v2">[218]</span> now says more correctly. The people have
no end of joy at seeing this mountain, for they consider it to be
the finger-post to Khartùm, and they are looking for the dome-palms
now as another sign. Three o’clock.—From E.N.E. to E.; then, with
the slightest bend, to N. The marsh-land is from a few inches to
half a foot high, on dry ground; there are some ant-castles on it,
and water-reeds and solitary ambak-bushes on the left. A little
forward to the N., and the so-called Gazelle River rushes with
great force close before us. Unfortunately, this is another pretext
for the gentlemen engineers to stop—yet uselessly—whilst we ought
to make good way with the favourable wind, in order to follow the
Sobàt further. We go also immediately to the right marsh-reeds, as
usual to collect gnats for the night. The Nuèhrs love their cattle,
and, like children who won’t have their pigeons and rabbits killed,
are excessively delighted at watching their growth and increase. We
see not only from this that these people do not kill the animals
for eating, but also from the manner in which they decorate the
beasts, insomuch as they put on them broad necklaces, covered with
little conical bells. The necklaces are of iron, and, as this metal
is very rare amongst the Nuèhrs, they seem to take more pleasure in
manufacturing ornaments than arms, though the latter are of the
first and highest importance to a people living in a state of
nature; yet they may, nevertheless, be richly provided with them,
and do not wish to display their warlike side to us, for we have
lost their confidence by the barbarous conduct of the first
expedition. A closer investigation of this nation might give
interesting results: their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_219_v2">[219]</span> curly, not woolly hair, the antique form
of their bows and quivers, their war-caps, similar to those of the
Egyptians, and their worship of animals, would serve as a very
instructive guide in the Ethiopian labyrinth of history.</p>

<p><em>5th March.</em>—Nothing done, unfortunately, by the
engineers: I myself could not land, owing to the marsh-reeds.</p>

<p><em>6th March.</em>—Dined with Selim Capitan, where Arnaud had a
fit of indigestion, from having eaten too many futir (tarts).</p>

<p><em>7th March.</em>—At last Arnaud went in the sandal to
circumnavigate the lake, without saying a word to any one of his
intention, because he means to pretend that he has seen everything,
and to impose on the Basha by a large bakshis. This lake is said to
make a great figure on his map, which he must have got others to
compose for him at Paris, because he himself is not capable of
doing it, as Sabatier expressly declared. Yet he was so close to us
all the time he was navigating it, that we never lost him out of
our sight. He wished also to investigate the Gazelle River by
himself, but he was afraid of remaining with the sandal in the
reeds at night, where he might have become a victim to gnats or
other monsters. The Bach’r el Gasàll does <em>not</em> display at
this time of the year <em>any</em> fall, nor does the Nile here in
the lake, although the breadth of its stream is clearly
distinguished from the bluish water of the latter by its muddy
colour. The lake has fallen about a foot since our ascent, of which
we have plain proof by our shore. There is want of wood on board
the vessels, because the crew have kept up a clear fire
every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220_v2">[220]</span> night to
drive away the gnats, without even giving a thought that the smoke
alone has that effect. With respect to this abominable brood of
insects, I earnestly advise all future travellers to provide
themselves with a musquito-net (Arabic, nammusië, from nammùs,
gnat) if they wish to escape the torments of hell, and to preserve
their health and perhaps their life. I myself shall be grateful to
God if I only remain strong enough to continue and end my journal
as accurately and faithfully as hitherto; so that by its means I
may correct the maps which may be published subsequently, and
particularly with regard to the numerous windings and bends of the
river itself, which can only be followed by the strictest
attention.</p>

<p><em>8th March.</em>—Arnaud again to-day kept his intention very
secretly, and navigated the Delta before the Gazelle River—a famous
opportunity for relating anecdotes of continual adventures and
hippopotami-hunts. He really does gasconade too much: for example,
he states, quite at random, in the presence of Sabatier, the number
of miles he has navigated the last two days, although he has never
cast out the log; whereupon Selim Capitan laughs in his face.
Arnaud never scruples either to ask for anything that pleases him.
“Son Altesse,” serves always as his excuse, as if he were
collecting <em>only</em> for Mohammed Ali. At half-past ten o’clock
a few drops of rain fell. M. Arnaud having returned from his great
voyage of discovery, we sail out of the lake E.S.E. The weather
seems about to clear up immediately, although the sun casts a
certain watery gleam of light on the marsh-grass that we cannot
trust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221_v2">[221]</span>It thunders,
and we go with a west-wind right into the dark clouds. Half-past
eleven o’clock, the rain has fortunately come on; the wind has
changed from W. to N.E., and we go with oars again to E.N.E. A
quarter before twelve, the wind blows freshly on the right shore of
the reeds, where we make a whirl again, because the crew are tired
out by their sleepless nights. Drops of rain only are falling, but
the pell-mell confusion in which the vessels navigate is enough to
drive one to despair: no taking to the oars—no wish to do
anything—no command—the tailor-captain is sitting at his
handy-work.</p>

<p>The shores are, or form, short reeds and grass standing in the
water. Twelve o’clock; to E. Half-past twelve; S.S.E. One o’clock;
E. by S., a large lake to the right, scarcely separated from us.
Two o’clock; with a trifling declination left to S., and in a flat
arch, E.S.E. The wind has changed to the south, and we sail a
little—two miles. However we see showers of rain pouring down
nearly all round us, and it will be fortunate if we escape them,
for where could we fly to to preserve ourselves from the rain which
soaks through in these regions? Half past three o’clock; from S.E.,
with a few deviations to E. by N.: we make four miles, for the wind
has settled in south west, whereby a few drops of rain sprinkle us
from the right side, and we go then directly a short tract N.N.E.,
leaving behind us a <em>large</em> floating-island, very rare here
in comparison with the small ones. A quarter before four; with a
short bend to E.S.E. and E., then from E.S.E.; on the right here a
large lake; immediately at a quarter after four to S.E. by S., and
on the left to E.S.E. and E. by N.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222_v2">[222]</span>The rain is
like that of a German May. On the right shore, a somewhat scanty
forest, where we halt, at a quarter to five, on account of want of
wood; at five, however, we bear off again, for these little mimosas
afford us no wood. From S. to E.S.E.; a large lake again on the
right. How much earth must the mountains of Bari and elsewhere
supply before these shallow lakes can be elevated into land and
fields! Half-past six; from E. by S. to the left in E. and E. by
N., where it makes a leap to E.N.E. The wind has become slack: only
two miles. Six o’clock; to E. There are many swallows flying over
the reeds; they seem to be making a tour of pleasure with our
deadly enemies the gnats. These birds may either not anticipate the
rainy season, which is close at hand, (unless they are already on
the road to our home,) or they remain here entirely, and most of
them perish, as we have seen in Taka, where, however, the trees
protect them. Half-past seven; E.N.E. On the right a large lake: we
anchor in the middle of the river, and it begins to be dark.
Thermometer, sunrise, 22°; noon, not above 27°; sunset 27°.</p>

<p><em>9th March.</em>—We start, though it is raining, at six
o’clock, and go E.S.E. and immediately E., and sail with a
north-west wind to N.E. Seven o’clock; round the left to N.;
immediately, however, to the right, E.N.E. and E. The wind has gone
round to south east, and freshened, so that we make six miles. We
see from the deck ten villages scattered at some distance on the
left side, and a lake on the right. The lakes mentioned yesterday,
which were encircled here and there by ambaks on the side turned
from the river, and not, as usual, by the Habas, could only
be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223_v2">[223]</span> perceived
from the deck. We go at eight o’clock to S.E. with oars, after some
delay, in consequence of our vessel having come into collision with
Selim Capitan’s. The wind has slackened considerably: a large lake
on the left.</p>

<p>A good idea unfortunately often strikes us too late. Last night,
I was trying to defend myself with a fan against the onslaughts of
the gnats, but often let it fall from pure weariness. Continual
stings, however, soon waked me to pick the fan up again, till about
morning it came into my head to erect a small tabernacle over my
face, by means of a linen cloth. Yesterday evening I repeated that
contrivance, and was scrupulously careful in forming it, when I
found that the little pincers and pests would not let me eat in
peace, and poured out of their lurking-holes with bloodthirsty
intentions. I drew, therefore, my little conical canopy over my
head: I was very hot under it, but yet not a mosquito was able to
pierce through it. They buzzed and hummed outside, and the crew
cried, “Bauda! bauda!” but I was comparatively jolly, and of good
cheer.</p>

<p>A quarter after eight. E.S.E., then E. Some trees before us; two
villages seen from the deck, behind the reeds on the left. Nine
o’clock. Right round to E.S.E.; here, on the left, a little lake,
and three villages near the above-mentioned three or four trees,
ten minutes from the shore. The tokuls, which are not so large as
those previously seen, and have slightly arched roofs, seem to
denote that we have come already to the country of the Shilluks. It
does our heart good to see human habitations once again close to
us. The Nile has been really very tedious<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_224_v2">[224]</span> for a long time: I sit here, a “passer
solitarius in tecto.” I always thought that we ought to bring every
landscape before the reader’s eye, like a row of pictures on the
wall; but there is a continual and tiresome repetition of natural
objects here: yet I feel it my duty not to spare the reader. Ten
o’clock: continually E.S.E., with very inconsiderable declinations.
Several people and villages on the left shore, at five minutes’
distance: they are really Shilluks. From the deck we see
immediately ten large and small villages. We wind, still rowing, in
a flat arch to the right, S.E.; then to the left, E. by N., at
half-past eleven; and again slowly to the right. Four villages, the
last a large one, at our left: they lie intermixed on the bare high
shore, or rather grass and reed-sea, through which the river winds.
Some Shilluks, no doubt a very populous nation, greet us from the
shore with “Habàba!” (borrowed from the Arabs: in Taka, also, they
say habàba—otherwise, mirhabà). Three mountains project on the
right. Eleven o’clock, S.E.; three villages on the left. Half-past
eleven. Slowly from E.S.E. to the right, S.E. by E.; then to the
left, E., and the river immediately makes again a bend to the
right, in E.S.E. The wind freshens and detains us; yet we have
gained just this moment, for the river goes further to the right,
and the wind has changed to N. The high shores, behind which the
whole country is bare, with the exception of a few uschàrs, and
seems to lie higher, approach again the river on the left; and two
villages shew themselves at some hundred paces, on the
gently-ascending downs; below them the old river-bed appears on dry
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225_v2">[225]</span>The Shilluks,
armed with lances, and standing on the shore, shout again their
“Habàba!” but we sail now, and they do not offer us anything, much
as we should like to make use of their cows and wood; and besides
there are two many of them. Groups of tokuls stand in a row. A
quarter after twelve, continually E.S.E. Half-past twelve, S.E. by
E.; to the left, E. The wind has changed, and is contrary; so we go
E.S.E. The Shilluks also have sleeping-places, open at the top,
wherein warm ashes form their beds, with which also they powder
their hair, thereby making it look grey.</p>

<p>A quarter before one. From E. by N. A gohr on the right, and we
go, at one o’clock, E.S.E. Half-past one. The river takes a
direction before us to E., with some little inlets, so that we
cannot see the lower shore. The wind blows strongly against us from
E. We have but scanty fare, being without meat. I cannot deny
<em>kew</em> to myself now, for I really want it.</p>

<p>Half-past two. E. by S. A Haba on the right, before it a lake
connected with the river in front; the forest is upon a gentle
declivity, and covered with shrubs, thorns, and dwarf-trees, even
to the edge of the water. The shore also falls away gently to the
river, near which it only rises a little above the narrow green
margin of grass. We halt close to the right shore, owing to want of
wood.</p>

<p>The shore ascends to about fifteen feet high, where the trees
begin, and is composed of nothing but mimosas, although the Nile
very certainly does not flow over it; for the river has full play
far away to the left.</p>

<p>If we call these lakes, marshes, and reed-morasses,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_226_v2">[226]</span> a longitudinal valley,
enclosed as they are with the Nile between two high shores, which,
however, do not ascend to the due height, the original shores
perhaps lying still further by the irregular low line of mountains,
or rather hills, it is plain that the same is gradually filled by
alluvial deposits from the mountains of Bari, or from above, and an
accumulation of vegetables, or the momentary sprouting forth of an
corresponding kingdom of plants, must have soon followed the more
important vegetable matter. As the sluices of the so-called valley
pour into the great Nile, it must have falls on a level with the
Nile itself, and has, therefore, dug a bed, and made an even slope
to this side, after the stream had removed the first barriers or
dikes of the high shores, which are now secure from any inundation.
A river-bed, indeed, naturally becomes deeper when there is a
proper fall and a regular conduit. The lower Nile has elevated its
bed, because it has but few vents. Why could not the White River
have a similar retrograde connection of water, which is prevented
from flowing off, such as is the case, in the first place, near
Khartùm? The Nile here might have been previously in majestic
fullness, and flowed rapidly between the present old shores to
Khartùm, until it created shallows and islands, where reeds and
water-plants of every species sprang forth luxuriantly from the
nearly stagnant water, and vehemently opposed the natural course of
the river, seized the alluvial deposits from above in their
polypi-arms, and rose to what we now see to be meadows and
marshes.</p>

<p>The Shilluks are tolerably acquainted with<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_227_v2">[227]</span> the good disposition of the Turks: as
soon as a vessel approaches a group of them, they get up and go
away; this even befell Selim Capitan, in spite of his interpreter.
When they see us coming, they drive the cows from the water, even
without letting them drink. We on our side are afraid, and with
justice, to land on the inhabited spots. I brought back two
guinea-fowls, the produce of my shooting excursion with my
servants; I had seen Suliman Kashef with one of a similar kind
above. They are not at all like those in Taka, and different only
from those of Europe by the darker colour of their plumage. We
shall remain here to-night; thunder and rain have been satisfied
with merely threatening us,—and are happily over. I disembark once
more, and see fifty to sixty giraffes in the level shore towards
the horizon, but it was too late to get at them. The thermometer
was at nine o’clock in the morning 21°, but did not get up
afterwards to more than 28°, fortunately for us,—not so much on
account of shooting as because the heat might have been
insupportable, for we were between these high shores à talus, with
an average angle of 25° to 30°, and the wind was entirely
still.</p>

<p><em>10th March.</em> We remain to-day here for the sake of
shooting, conformably to Suliman Kashef’s determination. His
halberdiers set off to-night to follow the course of the giraffes,
and to find out their abode in the gallas,—unfortunately without
success, for they did not like perhaps to trust themselves so far
in the territory of their deadly enemies.</p>

<p>I remarked a number of burnt bones of hippopotami in the low
forest lying close to the river. I should<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_228_v2">[228]</span> be inclined to believe that the natives
burn the carrion intentionally, in order not to be exposed to the
disgusting effluvium. A species of black wasps build hanging-nests
here, which however seem from their transparency to contain very
little honey. I could not ascertain this more exactly, because I
was obliged to be cautious in breaking off a branch with such nests
on it. We remark low mountains beyond the softly ascending desert,
and perhaps the dry water-courses which issue here from the steppe
flow to them, and <em>there</em> may be the real abode of the deer.
In my shooting excursion I looked carefully among the thorn-bushes,
and found that the plants are mostly the same; I had fancied quite
otherwise. A blue convolvulus—not, however, belonging to the
water—displayed a lighter colour than usual, and had also round and
glutinous leaves: I took seeds of some pretty creepers and gathered
the fruits of the shrubs, for I was already acquainted with the
leaves. Every thing now was withered, and I am curious to know what
will become of the various seeds I have collected when they are
sown in Europe.</p>

<p>Most of the birds had retreated before the shooting of the other
sportsmen commenced, but I stumbled upon several turtle-doves, and
instinctively grasped my gun, letting my botanical bundle fall on
the ground. I shot some, and got under a tree, where I saw them
fluttering around. The thorns stuck to me and pricked me all over,
and there I sat bent, like an ostrich caught in a thorn bush,
compared with which the bull-rush of Moses was a child. I could not
force through it with my coat on and gun in my hand; so I got loose
from the sharp barbs of the thorns with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_229_v2">[229]</span> torn clothes, leaving behind the
tarbusch, takie, and half my cowl, without even scratching my ears,
though they were bleeding enough already. I fetched back my
tarbusch by means of my gun, and then examined my malicious enemy a
little closer, notwithstanding he was an old acquaintance. I found
withered apples on it, and gathered some, for the sake of the seed;
when green they are exceedingly similar to oranges or Egyptian
lemons. I have not found it confirmed that they are deadly poison
to camels.</p>

<p><em>11th March.</em>—“Bauda mafish, am’d el Allàh!” (the latter
properly Hamdl el Allàh,) was the cry on all sides to Allàh,
because the gnats had taken their departure, and I hope that those
which are still in my cabin will soon follow their companions.
Departure at a quarter before ten to S.E. by E., then a little E.
by S. Summer or pastoral villages on the left: we perceive also
herds, but not a morsel of them is destined for us. On the right an
old river-bed or narrow lake, mostly marshy, and connected below
with the river. A quarter after ten, E.S.E., on a pretty good
course, with the exception of some shallow inlets. We sail, with a
south-west wind, four miles. On the left again open reed-huts or
sleeping-places, and herds to which the people are collecting,—on
account of the Turks. All the Haba here is deposited soil, which
lies almost always higher than the other ground. This evidently
fading forest once enjoyed better times, when the blessing of rain
was afforded it, but the benefit of which it lost directly by its
higher situation.</p>

<p>What fables are told of the incredible luxuriance of the
tropical kingdom of plants! At all events it<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230_v2">[230]</span> could only be said of aquatic plants
which are forced by water, evaporation, and sunshine, as if by
steam or chemical preparations; but then only in the rainy season
and a few weeks beyond. I saw, indeed, trees shooting forth at this
time in Taka, which boiling and cauldron-shaped valley may perhaps
contain a tropical growth, or something like it; and plants
springing up from the morass with incredible celerity and
luxuriance, as if by magic. But trees that have true manly vigour,
and strive to shoot out with sound strong muscles, whose pith is
still clearly to be seen in the bark, with not a bough injured,—not
a branch hanging down withered,—these are sought for in vain in the
Tropics, so far as I have seen. We can form a tolerable idea of the
momentary life and vigour there by comparing in Europe, acacias,
planes, and poplars, on suitable soil; it is the most cheerful
awakening after a long repose: but part of the limbs always
continues in a sleep-like death, whether it be under the bark of
the stem, or a bough that the sun scorches, or a runner become dry,
which disfigures the whole tree. A forest requires care, either by
the fortuitous kindness of Nature herself; or, when that is not
sufficient, by the directing hand of man. The omnipotence of the
terrestrial womb of fruits is past,—that which gave previously the
magic of lovely green to the coming species, without any visible
seeds of themselves. Half-past eleven o’clock, S.E.—It has just
rained a little;—what anxiety and fear of rain these half-naked
coloured people shew; what care they display in preparing
immediately a tent to sit under! I have very often remarked this;
rain must therefore make a sensible impression on their<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_231_v2">[231]</span> hot skin. Twelve o’clock,
E.S.E. We see at the distance on the left towards the horizon,
solitary dhellèbs as usual on elevated ground; and also isolated
little groups of Shilluks. Narrow tracks of water right and left,
which not long ago were flowing cheerfully. The river has also
gradually laid aside its terraces in preceding times, until it has
limited itself to its present bed; and those parts of the shore,
lying higher are only just moistened, even when it is at its
highest water-mark. It would be interesting to follow these old
river-beds in the ascending line at the side, and to arrive at the
dams of the primitive stream, or at the higher circumvallation
which surrounded the lake here at one time. A quarter after one
o’clock.—On the right a gohr cul-de-sac, low bushes to S.E., called
by the very same name as the Haba; on the left solitary trees and
straw huts of the herdsmen. At two—on the right, another gohr
cul-de-sac,—to E. We sail E.N.E, and wind, for the first time since
the morning, to the left: a track of water in the shape of a
terrace, just there, from half a foot to a foot higher than our
level. A beautiful line of dome-palms before us, but still thicker
a little to the left. Half-past three, N.E.—Heaps of simsim-sheaves
on the water at the left, and a row of ten villages near the
dome-palms. A broad gohr or river comes from W. This may be the
river of the Jengähs; but it seems to approach in the background
too much to the Nile; perhaps therefore it is that gohr which is
said to have its old river-bed on the high shores, below the
villages of the Shilluks. A quarter before three, E. We see on the
left seven more large and small villages, by or near that row of
dome-palms, which on this side is very<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232_v2">[232]</span> thin; then a dome-forest to the left at
a quarter of an hour’s distance.</p>

<p>An unlimited water-course before us in E. by N., but no huts to
be seen on the left. Therefore, the nation of the Nuèhrs might have
been dislodged by the Shilluks from that quarter; for the former
extend, or are said to extend, up to the Sobàt and its shores. This
side, at all events, had been inhabited, as I plainly saw this
morning at our landing-place. The Haba, however, continues at a
slight distance from the river; on the left also the dome-forest is
now reduced to a strip of a wood. The shores are surprisingly low
on both sides; and therefore not any tokul-village is to be seen
near them. A gohr is on the right, which is scarcely separated from
the river, and in connection with it, like the other narrow ones.
Three o’clock. On the left three more villages in the dome-forest
tract; and on the right and left parrallel gohrs, subordinate
Niles, which are now stagnant, and the fish in which are a prey to
men and beasts. Four more villages to the left, near the dome-wood
retreating from the river; on the right the forest thickens.</p>

<p>Half-past three. Towards S. We have a tolerably high and
apparently planted island at our left, and halt at the right near a
hill—probably a deserted domicile. But look there! that is really
the far-famed Sobàt, the water of which is flowing against us, and
which is so much feared by the crew, who are tired of the voyage. I
soon disembarked on the shore, sauntered up the hill, and was
surprised to find that I could see so far in the distance, and fed
my eye and mind with a diorama which extended from W. to
N.E.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233_v2">[233]</span> The Nile is
conspicuous in the W., and meanders to N.E., where it is lost to
the sight. An isolated dhellèb-palm on the right shore indicates
this last boundary. The horizon behind this glittering length of
the Nile is adorned with a transparent forest of dome-palms,
interspersed with slender dhellèb palms, with their small heads.
The basin of a lake spreads from W. to N.W., at my feet, and the
river Sobàt winding downwards from S.E., and flowing in the depth
at my right, unites with the Nile near the lake: both its shores
are bare, and only a few melancholy straw tokuls stand on the
extreme point of the right shore. All the remaining part of the
district extends far and wide in a dead waste, with a little
withered grass; and the horizon alone from S.S.W. to S.W., displays
afar some palms and other trees, through which the blue sky
glistens.</p>

<p>The lake lying in the angle between the left shore of the Sobàt
and the right of the White Stream is connected with the former by a
narrow opening, evidently prevented from closing by the hand of
man. The mouth, as is the case elsewhere, is merely stopped up by
reeds, to keep the fish of the lake in confinement. Our blacks
shewed on this occasion what they do to catch fish when the water
of these lakes is shallow, and does not reach up to a man’s middle.
They disturb it with their feet, put fishing or conical baskets
into it, and harpoon the large fish, who come to the top to
breathe.</p>

<p>The Sobàt, swelling at high water far higher and stronger, has
raised unquestionably a dam against this lake, the former river-bed
of the White Stream, and pressed the Nile more towards N.W. into
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234_v2">[234]</span> present bed.
Notwithstanding such an advantage being at hand, the natives have
cut through the dam for the purpose of catching fish. The Sobàt has
shortly before its mouth a hundred and thirty mètres in breadth and
three fathoms in depth, whilst when we were here before it was four
fathoms; and according to Selim Capitan, a few days earlier last
year, five fathoms. We can tell but very little generally of the
depth of the Nile, because its bed is very uneven, and the stream
causes eternal fluctuations.</p>

<p>The name of Sobàt could only have been given to this river by
the Funghs, for the Arabs have never possessed it, and usually call
it Bach’r el Makàda (river of Habesch.) The Dinkas name the White
Stream Kedi, and <em>this</em> Kiti, which mostly denotes water in
the dialects on the White Stream up to Bari, where it is called
Kirboli: Kir also means water among the tribes down the river. Its
name is Tilfi and Tak with the Nuèhrs and Shilluks.</p>

<p>When I view the steep and high slope of the shores of the Sobàt,
and the proportionate thin layer of earth on the immovable strata
of clay or original soil, which here is twenty to twenty-five feet
higher than on the shore or in the bed of the Nile, I return to my
former conviction, that the immeasurable particles of stone and
plants stream by means of the breach, and flowing away of the lakes
of the Ethiopian highlands, to the lake of the basin-shaped valley
of the White Stream which flows off with the Nile, as the deepest
point; and that all the lower country under the mountain chains of
Fàzogl and Habesch, from the Atbara to the land of Bari must be
under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235_v2">[235]</span> water, if
it be not a lake connected with the depressed regions of the White
Stream. If the lakes, therefore, of that lofty plain were torn by a
powerful catastrophe, and deserted their chasms or valleys, as the
water-basins of Switzerland did formerly—(even now there are lakes
or flat valleys, signs of a deluge, in which the waters might have
dashed from the summit of Atlas to the top of the Alps)—there is no
question that the lower lakes or valleys must have filled and
overflowed. The first rushing-down of the mass of waves, incredibly
violent as it must have been, the falling of mountains accompanying
it, and their washing-away, overpowered everything below them, as
if gods had descended from Olympus, and no longer recognized those
limits that would have remained eternal obstacles by an inferior
shock. The first deposit was a layer of clay on the side of the
Sobat, whilst the White Stream suffered no such sediment when in
its primitive strength, and washed away everything that it could
seize, as is shewn by the far lower shores. The high shores of the
Sobàt and its environs fall away, especially towards the level
parts of the left side of the Nile, to which the accumulated slime
could still less arrive owing to the stream carrying it off,
although several gohrs and rivers from thence pour into it. These
afford water certainly, but no slime to increase the height of the
shore, as we plainly see by the Gazelle River, and also in the
little Kiti of the Jengähs called Njin-Njin. We must assume from
the Dinka country and its greater elevation, that the ground
towards the Nile was heightened formerly by its gohrs flowing from
above, or perhaps constant rivers; whilst<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_236_v2">[236]</span> Kordofàn, which lies over the left shore
of the Nile, discharges no rivers, and its oases have run down from
the mountains themselves, and formed islands in the sands which
still remain, for the sunken ground forms cisterns that nourish the
succulent power of the mountains by imbibing the moist element; or
it may be, that springs were bored by God’s own hand.</p>

<p><span class="sc">12th March</span>.—We set out at half-past nine
o’clock, and sail to S.E. by E. Shrubs on the higher shore to the
right. A quarter before ten, from S.E. by E.; further to the left
round a corner, to which a bend corresponds on the opposite shore:
this is often the case on the Nile. To E.N.E., and immediately
again with a short tract to N.E. The river flows with all its force
against the left shore, and therefore the latter is higher, more
perpendicular, and disrupt, than the right, which soon, however,
becomes similar. We go a short tract libàhn, and see a few
miserable small straw tokuls with <em>thin</em> doors, on the left,
in the little green underwood, which seems to be nourished by the
inundation, and is mostly young döbker.</p>

<p>The shores display again iron oxyde. A quarter
before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238_v2">[238]</span> eleven:
from E. by N., to the right, E.S.E., where we sail. The shores on
the right and left are higher, according to the current, and the
falling of the river is accurately marked out on the shore by
little gradations, which are exceedingly regular, and one to two
inches high. We crawl on only slowly with the faint south wind, and
make now one mile; for the current being stagnant below towards the
Nile, told me directly that the floating companion of the mountain
dissipates quickly its water, differently from the slow, crawling
Nile, which is obliged to work through the plain of a
lake-basin.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock. The wind freshens, and we go S.E. and E.S.E. On
the left a solitary dhellèb-palm rises on the shore, with its
beautiful and really symmetrical head; its slender base without
rings, and its elegant foliage. From hence in the bend, further to
the right, in S., where five dhellèb-palms break the uniformity of
the high shore on the left. A low ridge of a hill lies near them,
on which a village must have once stood. If I could but transplant
the tallest dhellèb to Louisa’s island, near Berlin, to make it the
common property of all the northern nations! It is hot, for the
high shores keep the refreshing breeze from the deep water, and
only the sail enjoys a cheerful gust of wind, with the assistance
of which we go, at a quarter before twelve, from S.W., where a
regular forest before us presents itself to the eye, to the left,
in S.W. by S. We make two miles; a quarter of a mile, perhaps,
being derived from the current. A quarter after twelve, from S.W.,
to the left, E. by N. We hardly move from the place till it blows
from N.E., and then we go better, having<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_239_v2">[239]</span> four miles’ course. An old sailor runs
on shore close by the vessel, to find crocodiles’ eggs; tumbles
into holes, falls in the grass, and is using every exertion to find
a convenient sand-path instead of the clay. The crew call him to
come off, but he wants to shew that he is a nimble fellow—thus
every one has his hobby-horse.</p>

<p>The river winds continually in a bend to the left: a wretched
stunted forest on the right, and miserable tokuls, without people,
here and there on this shore. One o’clock; from E. by N., where the
river winds again to the right, S.E. by S. We halt at a quarter
before two, at the right shore, yet not to let the men rest; that
would be against the Turkish custom, for they think there are no
human beings except themselves. At three o’clock we go with libàhn
to S.E., and immediately to the left E. Half-past three, in a bend
to the right, S.S.E.; and four o’clock, on the left, in the bend,
to E.S.E. Five o’clock, from E.N.E., on the right to E., where we
stop at the right shore.</p>

<p>Last night I awoke up several times, and the wild geese on the
neighbouring lake, seemed to call to me in a friendly manner, and
scream “Here <em>we</em> are, for you have not had for a long time
either sheep, goats, or fowls.” I was on the wing therefore at
day-break, but saw only four royal cranes (grus royal, Arabic
gornu, or chornu), one of whom I shot, for they are very delicious
when dressed in a ragout. Feïzulla, although he has been seven
years in England, drinks drams and wine like a Turk, and scruples
to dine with me, because I had not cut the bird’s throat
immediately after it was shot, whilst it was yet<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_240_v2">[240]</span> alive, and made it debièg
(koscher, as the Jews say). These beautiful birds, with a tuft of
golden hair and shining feathers, appear in flocks on the White
River: my Sale killed a brace in a moment, and would have brought
us more if he could have followed them. The geese would only
surrender at discretion to the “longue carabine,” and I had only my
short double-barrel.</p>

<p>I visited once more, on this occasion, the hill above-mentioned,
which I found quite adapted for the situation of a village. I had
seen already the remains of potters’ ware, and solitary
flower-gardens, or plots of ground trodden down, where once tokuls
stood, but where now neither grass nor shrubs could grow; and I
came to the conclusion that a considerable village must have stood
there, which could have belonged only to the Nuèhrs, and was
probably destroyed by the Shilluks. Thermometer, sunrise, 21°;
half-past nine o’clock, 28°; noon, 29°; no rise beyond that was
perceptible afterwards.</p>

<p><em>13th March.</em>—Departure at seven o’clock, with libàhn to
E.S.E. by E.; then to the left, E.N.E., and we sail with a good
north-east wind. A quarter before eight: from E., in the bend to
S.E,; on the left some straw tokuls. The wind becomes strong, and
we make six miles for the present; the mountain stream seems to be
here at its lowest pitch, and has only a quarter of a mile
rapidity. Eight o’clock; from S.E. by S.; to the left, E. by S.,
where we are obliged to go libàhn. A quarter after eight, to the
left, but we halt before the corner of the bend till noon, owing to
the violent east wind. I made a little excursion into the
immeasurable plain, which was tree-less<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_241_v2">[241]</span> and comfortless; and found two villages,
better built than usual, to which I was not able to approach, and
likewise a long and dried-up marsh. I could not, unfortunately,
discover any guinea-fowls in the durra-stubble.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, we proceed with libàhn to N.E., where our
Bach’r el Makàda winds again to the right. Half-past twelve. The
shores, with few exceptions, attain a height of fifteen to eighteen
feet: the upper surface of the soil consists of humus to two or
three feet deep (which may be deeper in the low ground, old gohrs,
and several tracts), and under it nothing is seen but clay or mud,
having a yellowish colour on the shore, from the iron oxyde, with
which it is strongly impregnated, and generally more so than on the
White Nile, where this is only the case in layers. A fertile
country, but requiring human hands, canals, and sakiën. We see from
its shores, and in the dried-up pools, which receive very little
nourishment here from vegetable matter, particularly on the upper
land, that the Sobàt brings down fruitful earth or slime.</p>

<p>From half-past twelve to two, in a bend to the left, S.E., where
we go again left in N.E. by N. On the same side there is a
tolerably well built little village on the shore. A quarter before
three, still further to the left, N. by E. Four o’clock, we wheel
to the right in E.N.E., where we get the view of a genuine low
forest, and notice on the left a village in the winding to S. by E.
Half-past four, also further; a hamlet on the right with straw
tokuls, the first on this side. We see here also reed-boats, as
among the Nuèhrs and Shilluks on the Nile. At five o’clock
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242_v2">[242]</span> S., where we
at first halt at the right shore, before the bend to the left. Two
large villages lie from half to three-quarters of an hour distant,
and I see an immeasurable bare plain cracked from drought,—a summer
shallow lake without any verdure. We go then to the left shore, the
soil of which is less mixed with sand than that of the right, and
gives us some hope of shooting and fishing. The huntsman Sale
returned, however, disconsolate, for he had seen nothing at
all.</p>

<p>The left shore is still more precipitous and higher here than
the right one, because the stream forces itself into this bend.
When we disembark, we find that the land again rises to a gentle
acclivity, and we have the prospect of a large lake about three
quarters of an hour distant, which overflows perhaps deeper into
the Sobàt. Many lakes of this kind must be found in the country of
the Dinkas, because springs, as in the Taka country, are not
sufficient for the watering of the cattle of this merissa-loving,
dancing and singing tribe; and besides, the drawing of the water
would cause too much trouble.</p>

<p>The Sobàt is stagnant here in the proper sense of the word, and
no log can determine anything else.</p>

<p><em>14th March.</em> We navigate again on the right side, and go
at half-past seven o’clock with libàhn from S. by E., immediately
S.E., where the north-east wind remains contrary to us,
notwithstanding the narrow water-tract. Some small and still green
reed-huts hang on the shore, sheltered from the north wind: these
are stations for hunters of hippopotami and crocodiles, or for
fishermen, who, however, have gone away, and taken with them their
working implements, for they<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_243_v2">[243]</span> are frightened of us. The durra seems to
thrive famously on the half-sandy shore, and rises cheerfully above
the reeds; probably it is sown,—that is, a handful thrown here and
there on the vacant spots.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock—E. by N., and N.E. by E. The upper margin of the
right shore is planted throughout with durra, and some small
fishing-huts shew that men dwell there. Ten o’clock.—Hitherto
always N.E. within considerable deviations, and then N. by E.;
where we halt at the corner of the right shore on account of the
wind, for the river goes still further to the left: level land
above, some underwood, and a village at a little distance. A
quarter before one.—N. by W., and about one, in a bend to the
right. When the crew relieve one another at the rope, they imitate
to perfection the Uh-uh-i-ih of the tribes on the upper part of the
White Stream, and during the towing itself they sing the song
à-à-à-jòk-jòk, which would be difficult for a white man to do. The
force of the water is directed here against the right shore, which
is without any crust of vegetation, and seems to ascend to the
uppermost margin, as is proved by the gradations being washed away,
and the thin layer of humus, one foot to one and a half high,
decreases perpendicularly, whilst the lower part of the soil
displays unmixed clay. It certainly required a powerful pressure of
water to wash this primary deposit to such a depth; the left shore,
on the contrary, has a coating of slime and vegetation down to the
water.</p>

<p>Two o’clock.—E. by N.; twenty-one dhellèb-palms on the left,
with a pastoral hamlet of thirty new straw-tokuls. The crew are
beginning to shoot down the dhellèb-fruits, and I also disembark on
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244_v2">[244]</span> shore,
beyond which the ground, with the beautiful group of trees, is
still imperceptibly elevated. We are quite comfortable there, but I
gaze far and wide for a point to break the unbounded flat waste
that shews not a thorn or a bush; the river winds melancholy
between the naked shores. These palms stand in luxuriant growth,—a
proof that the soil is capable of other things, and may look for a
better future. The very pretty straw-huts present nothing worth
having to our rapacious eyes, and near them we remark the
sleeping-places, and a large, glimmering heap of dung, serving at
night for fire and a bed. The cow-dung is collected in little heaps
in the enclosure, surrounded with palings, where the beast is tied,
and is still quite fresh: notwithstanding this, it is very certain
that we expect in vain the return this evening of these beautifully
spotted cattle. Standing on an old trunk of a tree, I remarked a
large village on the right shore at a quarter of an hour up the
river.</p>

<p>The dhellèb-tree has the same fibrous texture of bark, and of
the interior of the trunks, as the dates and dome-palms; but it is
far finer, thicker, and stronger. The outside of the bark shews
rings from below upwards, and the tree itself shoots forth
slenderly from the earth, and swells gradually towards the centre
to a spheroid form, when it decreases again to the top, and rises
stately, separating the head from the stem. The fruit is as large
as a child’s head, and in clusters, as in the palms before named,
but on far stronger stalks, from which it hangs down immediately
close to the stem. It is smooth outside, and of a golden colour,
like its pulp; the latter is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_245_v2">[245]</span> fibrous, of a bitter-sweet taste, like
chewing soft wood and leaves behind in the mouth an astringent
taste, which may arise here from the fruit not being fully ripe.
There are from four to six kernels in this gold apple of the size
of a child’s hand, or of those of the dome-palms: the stalk has a
scaly covering, surrounding about a third part of the fruit. The
kernels, or the nuts, have themselves a solid pulp, shining like
dark glass, being exactly similar to that of the dome-fruit: at
first it is like milk, but on coming to maturity becomes of the
consistency of horn. The trunk of palms is surrounded with the same
kind of rings as the date-tree, the rind feeling smooth, like
planed wood; consequently it was impossible to climb these trees to
gather any fruit, owing principally to the swelling in the centre,
and therefore it was shot down. After several attempts, we drove
large nails in the stem, to hold the rope by, and then we ascended
gradually.</p>

<p>The bark falls off on the ground, as is the case with the other
palms, for the tree throws out foliage like grass from the
interior: the thick rootlets spread themselves in all directions
through the ground, like polypi, with a thousand veins of life.</p>

<p>There seems to me to be no doubt that the Egyptian pillars,
protruding in the middle, derived their origin from the
dhellèb-palms, which might have been transplanted in the Thebaïs;
for it was impossible that the Egyptians should not take notice of
the unusual shape of this tree—they who borrowed all their forms
and embellishments, even to those of their spoons and salve-boxes,
from the kingdom of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246_v2">[246]</span>Lifeless
figures having no meaning are never represented by them; flowers,
foliage, leaves, sacred animals, or parts of them properly
introduced, are intermixed with hieroglyphics, like a garland,
without beginning or end. The Greeks quickly seized what was
beautiful in this, discarded what was heavy and confused, and
pleased themselves and succeeding ages by lighter and more elegant
forms. They placed the acanthus and horns, or volutes on the
capitals of their pillars, and the Germans planted a stone-forest
as the holiest of holy.</p>

<p>A large village of the Nuèhrs (judging from several potsherds)
stood on our hill: this nation dwells up the river from hence and
in the direction of the White Stream, where we had seen them last.
I had found also on the last landing-place fragments and the
foundations of a village, and heard from our blacks that the
Shilluks, several years ago, had a great war with the Nuèhrs, drove
them from these parts, and took possession of the lake abounding in
fish, which I have previously mentioned. We have not remarked any
sunt among the mimosas from the country of Bari up to the Sobàt,
and even on this river, but we see talle. The latter tree has a
reddish bark; the long white prickles grow by couples; the flowers
are whitish and without any particular scent; the bark, however, is
used for pastilles, and, when rubbed, sprinkled on the merissa. It
affords the best gum (gamme, semmag), which is white like that from
sunt, while that from the sejal (or sayal) is blackish. Thermometer
yesterday morning 22°, and did not rise beyond 27°, and this
morning 18°; noon 26° to 29°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247_v2">[247]</span><em>15th
March.</em> We leave our beautiful palms at half-past nine o’clock,
and go from E. by N., and notwithstanding the strong north-east
wind, slowly in the bend to the right. A quarter after ten, S.E. by
E., then a very short tract S.S.E.: some grass huts of fishermen,
and crocodile and hippopotami hunters at the lower declivity of the
shore on the left. Half-past ten, to the left S.E., and further to
the left, S.E. by E., where we halt at eleven o’clock, because an
Arabian soldier has just cried himself to death before our cabin!
He wept at having to die in a foreign land and not seeing his
mother any more. Nearly all these people lose their courage
directly they are attacked by any illness, the nature of which they
cannot visibly perceive as they can a wound, &amp;c. He died with a
piece of bread in his mouth, because the Arabs believe, and with
justice, that so long as you can chew bread you will not die. It is
shameful that we dare not take even medicine from the fine black
physician we have on board, and much less can we expect assistance
or salvation from him. Ten minutes have flown; the deceased is
carried to the upper part of the shore, and yet the worthy disciple
of Clot-Bey has never even looked at him! We leave at half-past two
the place where the soldier was buried in dead silence, after
having received five more cows, upon whom the crew fell like
wolves, and navigate to the left, E.S.E.; then again slowly to the
right. Three o’clock, to S.E. We sail about five minutes, and stop
again at the right shore, by the corner where it turns to the left,
and then again, “Jo hàmmet, Ja mohammed!” is chaunted at the rope.
In the winding below the left shore we saw a water-hunting
establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248_v2">[248]</span> of
seven straw tokuls. A quarter before three, from E.S.E. to E. by S.
A quarter after four, E.S.E. Half-past four, E. Some few trees on
the right entirely or partly withered, and soon afterwards a few
green ones, of which those standing lower shew that the water has
poured into the shores, even to the margin. Five o’clock, E. by N.,
then slowly right to E., where we halt at a quarter of an hour
later. The river makes a strong bend to the right, and we hope to
sail to-morrow.</p>

<p>This afternoon, when the cows were brought us, I procured a
ring, with much difficulty, for sug-sug, and though badly
manufactured, it is at least peculiar to the country. I saw several
such rings among them, but not one of them had a circular form, and
by this we may measure the standard of their skill. Those which are
better worked, are found among the Nuèhrs. The five cows came from
the Mek, who presented himself in person to Suliman Kashef, with
whom Selim Capitan also happened to be: he was clothed in a ferda,
which he had received from the Shilluks. He wore a very thick
copper ring on his hand, and was of opinion that dress is the
privilege of sheikhs. An old woman and a man preceded him; the
former attired like an ancient Queen of the Witches. We dressed the
mek in a red caftan, put a gay-coloured red handkerchief round his
head, and hung glass beads on him. Another cow was brought to us,
but they wanted an enormous quantity of sug-sug for it, (these
trinkets are generally held in little value here, because the
Gelabis frequent these regions,) and still more for goats and
sheep. Thermometer, sunrise, 18°; noon and subsequently, 28° to
30°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249_v2">[249]</span><em>16th
March.</em>—Man is not appalled in the midst of danger itself,—if
it were so, he would be lost; but the frail human heart throbs
afterwards. Yesterday evening I left the vessel, in company with
Thibaut, to get at a swarm of finches, which birds are said to give
a delicious flavour to a pillau, of which we wanted to be joint
partakers. We were soon obliged to separate, in order to salute the
birds on both sides of their settlement. In my excursion, however,
on the shore, I came all of a sudden within a few steps of a lion,
without having the least distant idea that this fearful enemy could
be in the neighbourhood of all our vessels, and I had only my
double-barrel, which was loaded merely with small shot; whilst my
huntsman Sale, was pursuing a gazelle, at a long distance off.
Possibly our firing had awakened this supreme chief from his sleep,
for otherwise I must have seen him before, although my eye was
directed to a brace of birds at the left; because the underwood
could not have concealed an object of such size, as it only reached
up to the knee, and was merely interspersed here and there with a
higher bush. I was just taking aim slowly and almost irresolutely
at the two beautiful birds, who were looking at me with surprise
and confidence, contrary to the custom of the cunning finches, when
the lion stood before me on the right, as if he had sprung from the
earth. He was so close to me that he appeared to stand as high as
up to my breast, but yet I stood, my poor weak weapon in my hand,
holding it close to my side, with perfect presence of mind, so as
to keep my face free, and to wait for the attack; I was firm, and
he seemed also to be resolute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250_v2">[250]</span>At first we
stared at each other mutually; he measured me from top to toe, but
disregarded the Turkish accoutrements and sun-burnt countenance,
for my red cap which he seemed not to despise. I, on my side,
recognized in him the dreaded king of beasts, although he wore no
mane, according to his usual custom, but I did not appeal to his
magnanimity. At last he turned his face from me, and went away
slowly with a dreadfully pliable movement of his hinder parts, and
his tail hanging down, but could not restrain himself from turning
round to look at me once more, while I was trusting to the effect
of one or two shots in the eyes or jaws, if it came to a contest of
life or death; and really I remained standing immovable, with too
much of the <em>lion</em> in me to tremble, and to bring certain
destruction on my head by untimely flight. However, away he went,
looking round several times, but not stopping, as if he feared
pursuit, and I turned my back to him equally slowly, without even
calling out a farewell; but I cast a searching look over my
shoulders every now and then, right and left, expecting that he
might make a spring like a cat, and I kept him in sight before me,
when I was about to jump down from the shore on to the sand where
the vessels and crew were. I confess openly that I now felt an
evident throbbing of the heart, and that my nose seemed to have
turned white. Taken unawares as I had been by the lion, the
distance of five paces, according to the measurement I made, was
nearly too close for me: on his side it was only necessary for him
to have smelt me, which probably I should not have allowed. I stood
a moment on the margin of the shore, in order that I might
tranquilly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251_v2">[251]</span>
summon Suliman Kashef to the pursuit of the beast, without
betraying any pallor of countenance, and then I jumped down on the
sand. When I swore by the prophets to Suliman Kashef that my
account was true, he was ready immediately with his sharpshooters.
At my advice we formed a line of riflemen above, though I could not
obtain a couple of bullets for my gun; but the Turks soon crawled
together again, except a tall black slave of Suliman’s, who was at
the right wing. When the latter soon afterwards pointed and made
signs that the lion was near at hand, his master motioned with his
hand and gun that he would shoot him if he did not join us, for he
held himself as lost, being left quite alone. We set off at a
slight trot, because the lion continued his walk, until at last
Suliman, as it began to get dark, ordered three of his boldest
warriors to go in advance. Three shots were fired, but the men came
back, and described the lion as a real monster. I was actually glad
that the magnanimous beast, according to all probability, was not
even wounded. They called me again an “Agù el bennaht,” because I
accompanied the expedition to see my lion a second time, and they
expressed themselves rejoiced that God had preserved me, and wished
me happiness, with pious phrases from the Koràn.</p>

<p>To-day we sailed at half-past six o’clock from the place to S.E.
and S.E. by S.; at seven o’clock; E. by S., a village on the high
shore at the right.</p>

<p>We saw yesterday, from our landing-place, four villages, lying
together on the right and left shore, which the Dinkas have taken
into their possession. At half-past seven o’clock, after we had
sailed only slowly (two miles), owing to the wind being
partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252_v2">[252]</span> adverse,
we proceeded to E.S.E. and S.E. by E. The strong breeze caught the
sails, and we make seven miles clear of deduction: unfortunately,
the tract will not be long. A quarter before eight we stop before
the corner, where a winding to the left commences, in order to go
libàhn, because the vessels ahead do it. Some huntsmen’s huts, with
their inhabitants, stand on the right shore, and I procure, on this
occasion, a horn of the Tete species of antelope. We proceed,
sailing, to S.E. by E., and E.S.E., and halt a quarter after eight.
Again at S.E. by E., to go libàhn round the left. Unfortunately,
the wind has torn the sail, which I had feared for a long time
would be the case; for it was ripped up in several places, and the
Tailor Capitan did not trouble himself about it. “Allàh kerim!” A
large village at some distance above. At a quarter before one, we
go libàhn to S.E. by E.; then E.S.E. and E. by S. On the right
shore a village with Dinka tokuls and sleeping-places. It is not
yet, however, decided whether the Dinkas dwell there, although the
style of architecture of the tokuls, their grooved and arched
roofs, without eaves, seem rather to denote that they belong to
this tribe than to that of the Nuèhrs. The wind is very strong, and
the crew are obliged to tow with all their might; but the river
winds now to the right, and we can, perhaps, sail. A quarter before
two. From E. by N., slowly in the bend to the right: a village on
the right shore, in the bend to the left, exactly like that on the
left side. Half-past two, E. by S. We cannot see anything of the
village here, owing to the high shore; and the blacks, who stood
shortly before in large numbers on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_253_v2">[253]</span> the shore, have fled because they saw
the Turkish countenances of Suliman Kashef’s halberdiers. The Turk
is pleased at such fear, which is associated with hatred and
contempt on the part of the negroes. A quarter before three; S. by
W. The wind makes the men at the rope run; but we are not able to
sail, because the river winds immediately to the left. We have a
low sand-island at our right. Our men will let nothing lie by the
huntsmen’s huts: tortoise-shells (water-tortoises), vessels,—such
as gadda, burma, gara—everything is carried off; for the blacks
have imbibed the Turkish notion of “Abit,” and are now askari
(soldiers), who pretend to know nothing of their countrymen.</p>

<p>Three o’clock. To the left in S. and S.S.E.; then again to the
right. Half-past three. We sail a little S. by W. and S. by E.; a
village on the left. The Dinkas appear to mix everything called
corn to make bread; such as durra, lubiën of different species,
gourd or melon stones, &amp;c., of which I have a specimen; and
also lotus seeds, found here in great quantities, and therefore
denoting that there are several lakes in the interior, and the
small rice I have mentioned previously. A large hippopotamus shewed
himself on the flat left shore: he was afraid of the vessels and
the shouting of the crew, and trotted in a semicircle, like an
immense wild boar, in order to plunge into the water with a greater
roar. Four o’clock. To the left E.S.E. Five o’clock. From E.
further to the left.</p>

<p>The crawling along these cheerless shores, notwithstanding the
shouting, jokes, teasing, and stumbling on board the vessels from
side to side, and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_254_v2">[254]</span> into the water, and the huzzaing when
that takes place—notwithstanding all the various kinds of
occupation and non-occupation which may amuse us for a short
time—is exceedingly wearisome; and it is well for me if I retain my
senses to sketch here and there an idea, which may be followed out
or rejected by those whose attainments are higher, and who have the
advantage of an enlightened circle, where opinions and views can be
expressed and discussed. Such a circle, however, cannot be found in
Bellet Sudan, or on board my vessel. We halt a little after six
o’clock in E.N.E., at the right shore. Thermometer, sunrise, 18°;
noon, 27° and 28°; sunset, 27°.</p>

<p><em>11th March.</em>—We had a great antelope-hunt yesterday
evening. Amongst others, there was an Ariel with twenty-five rings
on its horns, and a Tete, and three female Tilli. The latter, also
a species of antelopes, are of lighter colour than the Ariels, and
almost white, whilst the Tete has a dark-brown coat with white
breast and belly. The female Tilli are distinguished by having long
tails, but the males are said to be bare behind. I was not able to
leave the vessel sufficiently early to see a herd of more than a
thousand antelopes that were going to the watering-place. My
huntsman, also, who had struck into another road, saw some hundred
together; all the others agreed that there were these thousand
which I have mentioned. But they soon dexterously divided to the
right and the left on the immeasurable level of this land, where
there was merely low grass, wild bamie and a quantity of basil,
which latter was also met with on all sides in the countries
further up; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255_v2">[255]</span>
Suliman Kashef only shot four, and my Sale not a single one. I
myself could only see some antelopes on the horizon, because it was
already getting dusk, and I stopped with Sabatier close to the
vessels, in case some beast should be scattered from the herd, but
in vain. On this occasion, also, I saw two lions at a distance.</p>

<p>At night the wind blew in coldly at the door and windows, and
even this morning the north-east wind was cool. At half-past six we
proceed E.N.E., and in a bend further to the right E. and E. by S.,
where we make a stronger evolution to the right. Eight o’clock.
Libàhn from S.E. by S. to S. We glide over shallows apparently
consisting of rubble-stone; the wind becomes strong and tosses the
waves. A quarter before nine, S.E. by S. to S., then still more to
the left, where we are soon thrown by the wind on the left shore,
and stop in E.S.E. Thibaut is with me, and they are calling for
him; his ship is full of water, and all the crew are summoned
there: it is fortunate that we are near land. Selim Capitan
neglected to have the vessels caulked at Khartùm, or to order at
least gotrahm (instead of tar) to be applied to the parts which we
had stopped up with some oakum.</p>

<p>At five minutes’ distance above, a large village deserted by
people; we are magnanimous enough on our side to keep the crew from
plundering it. It is slightly elevated: the same is also the case
with the shore, so that shallow lakes are formed right and left, at
present dry, and having vents to the water, which apparently are
kept open by human hands for the sustentation of the soil,—on
which, however, nothing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_256_v2">[256]</span> is seen. A number of snail-shells are
lying together on the surface just as I have seen in other places,
and it seems that snails are eaten. We remain here on account of
the accident to Thibaut’s vessel, but the shores, <em>à talus</em>,
do not allow us to bring it on the dry land. Thermometer 17° and
24°.</p>

<p><span class="sc">18th March</span>.—We sail at a quarter before
seven o’clock with a cold north-east wind S.E., and then S. by E.
and S. The wind, however, becomes too powerful; twice are we driven
on oyster-beds—that is, on those thorn muscles, as if over stones,
and have reefed sails to prevent the ships from going to pieces,
their condition being so bad. A quarter after seven. From S. by E.
to the left. Visible sand-banks in the curve seem to block up our
road, but we managed to pass by them on the right, with the
assistance of the sails, close to the left shore towards S.E., and
away in the bend to E. by S. Half-past seven. S.E. by E., and then
a quarter before eight right round; six huntsmen’s tokuls being
near a sand-bank on the lower shore of the projection of the left
side of the river.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_258_v2">[258]</span> We halt on the left by a shallow island
clothed with low verdure towards S.S.W., and intend to stop here
to-day and to-morrow to make observations, and the most needful
repairs to the vessels and sails.</p>

<p>Suliman Kashef shot yesterday evening, at a gazelle-hunt, a
large antelope, called by the Arabs Tete, in the foreleg,
shattering it to pieces; the animal fell twice, but made off at
last on three legs. Sabatier and I had chosen the left wing, and
concealed ourselves with one of my servants in the high grass: the
former fired and missed. The cracked earth displayed a magnificent
soil: the grass, standing thickly in tufts, reached up to our
breast, and was a great obstacle at the beginning of our rapid
march. It was still green at the bottom, and the present
desiccation of the ground, on which we remarked everywhere the
traces of footsteps of wild beasts, and their dung, might therefore
have only taken place a short time. This grass, narrow and
three-edged, with cylindrical spikes, formed the principal produce
of the soil. Less common was the grass similar to our species with
flat two-edged leaves; it had knotty stalks like the three-edged,
but a couple of spikes grew together on each blade (I have remarked
this previously), which unfortunately were not yet at maturity, and
therefore very small. The third species of grass consisted of
slender reeds, cropped and sprouting anew, or trod on the ground. I
perceived, also, some bamie growing wild, and birds’ nests of grass
hanging on it.</p>

<p>I had lost sight of my comrade; and although at the commencement
of my excursion I had seen the vessels sailing up the river at my
side, it soon became dark. Suliman Kashef, however, had the
sagacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259_v2">[259]</span> on his
return to the vessels, to order the reeds to be set on fire as
signals, so that luckily I found my way back, though sinking every
now and then up to the knees into the deep foot-prints of
hippopotami close to the river,—a further proof that the shores,
being only slightly elevated, form shallow lakes here at the rainy
season, which are not dried up so soon.</p>

<p>I had taken a short walk previously on the left shore. The very
same appearances of water remaining behind were visible, and I
found muscles on the dry ground, amongst which were the Erethria
ovata. Long traces of little deposits of earth, which, on closer
examination, I discovered to be dams against the high water on the
shore itself; and the alluvial reeds in conjunction with the
muscles, make me conjecture that the Sobàt ascends over its shores
here, as in many other places. Behind these low deposits lay an
unlimited stubble-field on the other side of the village which lies
on a gently ascending hill, elevated perhaps by the remains of clay
walls, and stretching far beyond the horizon. The better kind of
tokuls have frequently a roof, but the eaves only project
inconsiderably: the smaller ones have a round form of roof, low
sleeping places and reed-hedges being between them. Dinkas are said
to dwell there; but not a person, not a living creature, is to be
seen. Thermometer, sunrise, 17°; noon, 28°; sunset, 26°.</p>

<p><em>19th March.</em>—We all dine together in the open air, after
an antelope-hunt. The island on which we are, is, properly
speaking, a large broad sand-bank, about a quarter of an hour long:
its somewhat elevated back is covered with verdure, and is
connected with the shore on the right at low
water-mark.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260_v2">[260]</span>
Purslane (Arabic Rigli) is found very commonly upon it; we see also
numerous birds fishing in the many tongue-shaped segments of the
upper part, and, in fact, sharing among themselves the narrow lake
on the high right shore, close to which is a village, from whence
the people have likewise fled. These feathered occupants seem to
remove very seldom from this happy place. The antelopes presented
themselves in great numbers; but Suliman Kashef’s body-guard,
though generally good shots, did not know the huntsman’s custom of
dividing and forming a chain, so as to catch the herd in the
middle. I had no inclination, either, to join in such a surrounding
of the game; for these Turks fire as if they were shooting in
files, and their guns carry far, and are always recommended to the
care of the supreme Allàh.</p>

<p><em>20th March.</em>—Departure at a quarter after nine o’clock,
with a favourable north-east wind, without sails, S.S.W. and S.W.
by W., where, on the right, behind the high shore, a village lies
in the bend to the left, and below it a broad sand-bank, on which
some long-legged water-fowls are wandering about. We leave at the
right side another sand-bank exactly similar to the former,
throwing its shallows far beyond the middle of the river, and halt,
S.S.E. at the right shore at half-past ten o’clock. Suliman
Kashef’s halberdiers bring eight antelopes, one of which I procure,
being the largest of the Tete species. This specimen is now in the
Zoological Museum at Berlin as a <em>nova species</em>.</p>

<p>The shores have widened here, and fall off in an angle of 45° to
50°: though they appear on this account lower, yet it is plainly
visible by the steeper<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_261_v2">[261]</span> places, that they always become higher.
It is only below in the places where the river beats against, that
the bluish clay is seen: the remaining part of the shores has,
apparently, merely constituents of the same, as is the case in most
places where the high water has not washed away the crust of humus
crumbling from above and covering the base of the surface; for the
original soil discloses itself immediately under the covering of
earth, as is seen in precipices, and clefts in rocks caused by
water. The river has also thrown or deposited thick layers on the
shores. We must not be deceived here by observing various strata of
earth mixed above and below with sand; this is a later alluvial
deposit.</p>

<p>A pure layer of clay is never to be seen, however, in these
tracts of strata, so far as I have remarked here and on the Nile.
If it does appear, it lies either as the foundation of the whole,
below on the banks of the water, as on the Nile; for all the ground
there is alluvial and earthy deposits, gained when the high water
is drawn off; or it rises, as in the Sobàt, with the talus of the
shores to the surface, which is covered with a crust of humus. The
Sobàt dug a bed for itself in firm clay-ground that resisted the
water, and remained tolerably constant in the trench opened by it,
without having altered its course, for no gohrs are seen on dry
ground; but perhaps, in some places, it has flowed over its bed,
and formed channels. On the contrary, the White Stream wallowed for
a long time in the deep slime of an emptied lake, before it threw
up solid dams, on which there are marshy forests, as on the old
shores. This long valley-basin lies also on a layer of clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262_v2">[262]</span>The Sobàt may
be considered as a further boundary of the peninsula of Sennaar,
and have given to the latter the name of Gesira. Certainly it has
been, like the Blue Nile, a main-road for the tribes of the
highlands of Ethiopia to the valleys of these countries; and this
must have been especially the case because it has no accompanying
marsh-lakes. Such nations could not have wound down from the
mountains of Bari and the highlands there, by reason of the many
marshes; for we are not to suppose that nomadic tribes can provide
themselves and families with a stock of provisions for a long
journey, or stow entire herds in their hewn-out trunks of trees
(canoes); and it is impossible that the cattle could have been
driven along the shore for their use.</p>

<p>The further I ascend the Sobàt, the plainer I perceive why the
right shore just behind Khartùm appears higher than the left, and
why I could not get rid of the idea that this oblique inclination
of the land was in opposition to the course and the mouth of the
Nile, but still might be explained. The deposit of particles of
earth and sand can only come from above, and will always try to
level and equalise the tracts of land which the Nile covers with
showers of rain, brooks, and rivulets. It is clear that the surface
is elevated by that means, and that, where these washed-away and
liquid particles of earth reach a stream like the White Nile, they
are carried down by it, without the other shore (the left side of
the Nile here) deriving naturally any advantages therefrom.</p>

<p>The high mountain chain of Fàzogl and Habesh mixed, as I
conjecture, its collective waters, owing to a breach in its
partition-walls, and their slime and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_263_v2">[263]</span> morasses, and perhaps entire hills of
decayed and corrupted matter connected therewith, filled depths in
the lower valley on the side of the Nile up to the Delta—its most
famous memorial,—and levelled the mountains of the neighbourhood,
when Bertat, Dinka, and the country between the Sobàt and Bari
rivers might have shot up in indomitable strength like artesian
wells. Such catastrophes roll mountains and masses like a brook
does its little pebbles, and throw up the water released from
confinement in the cavities of heights which attract and collect
it. A flood of liquid earth rolled then far and wide from the
mountains without order and with numerous arms, but conformably to
nature, the heavy particles sank. The water itself washed away,
smoothed and levelled the ground. Therefore now we perceive those
immeasurable plains on the Sobàt, whereon beasts cannot hide
themselves, and which would be without shelter in the rainy season,
if there were not mountains and forests in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Though it be mathematically proved that the great Nile runs in a
channel as upon an ass’s back, yet we find just the contrary in the
White Nile; but the Sobàt even displays that phenomenon, although
not at this moment, for its shores are emptied, except in the
lowermost grade. They lie and stretch higher than the adjacent
land, being heaped up by the waves of the river; they are, however,
generally narrow dams, only appearing wide in the places where
there are shallow lakes behind in distant connection, or overgrown
gohrs, the grass border of which more easily withstands that deep
washing away than these immeasurable plains, which might be called
beautiful from their<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_264_v2">[264]</span> splendid soil, if Ceres waved her golden
ears, and Pomona offered shade and fruit. They shew, indeed, but
little declination to the Nile, for which the Sobàt itself affords
the best standard, being stagnant, and its shores only increasing
in height here and there. The shores become higher, as on the great
Nile itself; the less precipitous ones (although this is only
local) are deceptive, as I have remarked several feet difference on
the disrupt shore, and still more on the return voyage. I cannot
divest myself of the idea that a lake has stood here also, or it
may be that the surface of the earth from the region above to this,
has been laid flat by the inundation, similar to the level fields
of Egypt.</p>

<p>There is an incredible number of deer on the shores of the
Sobàt, for I can add from my own conviction, so far as my eyes and
ears do not deceive me, that I saw herds of antelopes at least a
thousand strong—the Turks say from three to four thousand. About
evening they shew themselves in immense lines on the bare horizon
of the steppe, stand still, and approach—their tread sounds, in
truth, like the evolutions of distant cavalry; at last, as soon as
it is dark, they separate in the little bushes on the margin of the
shore, to descend to the water. Hitherto I have not been able to
seize this opportunity, because no one would remain with me on
account of the lions and other savage beasts prowling about here,
and it did not seem to me exactly safe, by reason of my close
acquaintance with the lion and his just revenge, to lie alone
behind a bush, and shoot some of the animals at a few paces off. My
cook, however, has promised to accompany me on such sport, when we
come again to a suitable place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265_v2">[265]</span>We proceeded
this afternoon at two o’clock with sails in a south-easterly
direction, and halted for the sake of antelope-hunting at three
o’clock, at the right shore, E.S.E., before the curve to the right.
Four o’clock: we sail to S.S.E., then a bend to the left, S.E. by
E., where we stop again to hunt and also to remain. An
antelope-herd of about sixty head was standing shortly before at a
little distance on the shore, like a flock of goats, in harmless
innocence and anticipating nothing evil. Wild buffaloes, lions, and
hyænas were seen by several of our men: where are the holes and
corners in which these beasts lurk? there must be mountains.
Thermometer, sunrise, 15°; noon, 26°, 27°; from four to five
o’clock, 28°; sunset 26½°.</p>

<p><em>21st March.</em>—We sail from our place at half-past six
o’clock, quite quietly, without a drum being beat, and go E.S.E.,
with a cold north-east wind. Half-past seven.—From E. Libàhn: again
to the left, E.S.E.; eight o’clock: and then again to the left at
nine, N.N.E., where we stop at the left shore for sport, pretending
that it is owing to the contrary winds.—Oh you Turks!</p>

<p>M. Arnaud now pays himself in skins, which he demands very
freely for “son Altesse,” but which he intends to sell in France at
500 francs the head. Eleven o’clock: we go with libàhn round a
corner, and come to N., whence the river winds again slowly to the
right, N.E. by N. and to E., where we are driven forward and indeed
without sails. I remark here that the lower border of the river is
rocky, with a layer of soft stone under the clay, from which it may
originate, and appearing to be limestone formation,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_266_v2">[266]</span> until we break off the
deceitful exterior, and the apparent corrosion by the action of the
atmosphere turns out to be alluvial deposit,—the clay, however,
remaining sticking to the hands like sand. One o’clock: E.N.E. All
the vessels bear up! Four o’clock: three reïs had been sent forward
with the sandàl to sound the water, and the men were honourable
enough to express their conviction that there was still a
watercourse: we shall get now regularly fixed upon every sand-bank.
I, for my part, would like to make yet a good way, for I may
stumble perhaps upon a firmer foundation of stone or something else
new. We proceed, therefore, further,—against Mohammed Ali’s will,
and certainly against Ahmed Basha’s, who may be very much in want
of vessels and men at this moment, without any invasion on the part
of England or France. E. by N., and we squat again. A quarter
before five o’clock: S.E. by E. Water is on the right, but we
cannot get there because the bed of the river is elevated in the
middle, and these banks are magnificently larded with the spiry
Conchylia, which would deprive the vessels instantaneously of their
beautiful caulking. The reïs are sent out again in the sandàl;
everyone is in doubt what is to be done. Suliman Kashef and Selim
Capitan want to return. An island lies in view above. I should like
to be there to make observations, but that cannot be. Thermometer,
17°, 28° to 30°, 27°.</p>

<p><em>22nd March.</em>—Suliman Kashef sails back for the sake of
the chase; two other vessels follow: obedience seems renounced. I
go to the island and shoot two antelopes, dark as it was. No
artifice, such as I have already related, was necessary in this
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267_v2">[267]</span><em>23rd
March.</em>—We set out indeed at seven o’clock in the morning for
the return voyage, but stop soon again, notwithstanding the
favourable wind at the right shore, because deer are seen close to
it. The Sobàt and the Blue river might be conduits for the high
land, like the Tigris and Euphrates, Indus and Ganges were for the
valley-land, made subsequently fit for the nourishment of nations.
Tradition and history up to our time, teach us that Nature was not
powerful enough, and perhaps did not wish it, to form everlasting
barriers between nations, whether seas, rivers, or mountains; for
the destination of man is perfectability, which can only be
attained by mutual commercial intercourse.</p>

<p>Was Africa, therefore, although in the same latitude as other
countries,—for example, Arabia,—exclusively created for the black
species, who, so far as I have had experience of them, will never
leave the low grade of intelligence in which they have been for so
long a time, until they come into a closer and more continuous
association with whites? Anthropophagy, indeed, makes the Nile the
partition-wall between Asia and Africa, instead of the Isthmus of
Suez and the Red Sea. Our Sobàt (as also perhaps the White river,
unless the black people from below ascended here after the drying
up of that part assumed by me to have been a lake, which may be
almost taken for granted if we consider the affinity of languages
from the Dinka country to Bari,) drew down probably only a black
race,—a younger stem, I conjecture, than that of Caucasus,—between
which and the nations of the Nile there is a total difference in
colour and manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268_v2">[268]</span>Habesh, like
a second Cashmere, might be the cradle of white men; no less than
Arabia, lying opposite, which has nourished perhaps the same
species, but burnt by the sun;—and if a black race shot up here
instead of the white, the rivers of High Asia that disembogue on
this side were large enough to import white people. The Red Sea and
the Persian Gulf must, indeed, at the very earliest time, have
formed nearly insurmountable obstacles, if antediluvian
shipbuilding, even without Noah’s ark, had not brought about
cultivation, and caused the necessity of exertion and the desire of
emigration; and who will answer for it that the Red Sea was not at
one time a Tempe, so that an excursion to Africa might have been
made under the shade of rose and orange trees? The divulsed coasts,
the washed-away sharp rocks of the dangerous shallows, and the
submarine mountains, might easily indicate that there was once a
small irruption.</p>

<p>Habesh might have been the real mother country of Nubia and
Egypt, by means of the fecundation brought from Asia. Nuba negroes
mixed with the whites, and became masters of the country, until
they were forced back to their mountains in Kordofàn,—still
remaining a pure race, and nothing being left of the whole Egyptian
policy but circumcision. The black nation on the Nile might have
been separated from that in Habesh by a cordon; and both of these
tribes preferred, on cultivation increasing, a comfortable life in
the city to the free one in the mountains, until the Romans
connected again Habesh and Egypt, and built Axum.</p>

<p>The shores of the Sobàt have hitherto been without<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_269_v2">[269]</span> wood; but I saw, upon the
shore behind the island just left by us, a row of trees, said to be
Döbkers, and probably were so; for I recognised the little solitary
shrubs, in which I and my servants had groped about till late at
night, to be young shoots of Döbkers, which seem to have sprung up
this year at high-water; and also nebek and telle. I found
water-thistles on the shore above in unusual abundance, and
collected also that clay which appeared to me previously to be a
layer of stone. It was not quite free from fine sand, which the
water had washed on the shore, and exhibited, therefore, a rough,
stone surface, without being so yet. But where it lay piecemeal
about the shore it was as hard and black as stone saturated with
water, and dried or burnt by the sun, for that luminary has the
power, with the assistance of rain, of vitrifying rocks; and we
have seen ourselves such greenish ridges and blocks in the Nubian
deserts.</p>

<p>According to Girard, the specimens I brought from the shores of
the Sobàt consist of a micaceous sand, dark-brown, ochrous clay,
chalky sand, and partly of a conglomerate composed of small
fragments of limestone baked together by the sun. The sand, where
it is pure, consists of several little yellowish grains of quartz,
a small portion of reddish feldspar, some brown iron-stone, little
brown tombac-mica, and a black mineral consisting of small grains,
the nature of which could not be exactly ascertained. These
materials indicate that the origin of the sand is derived from a
mica-slate and gneiss mountain not far distant; for if the sand
were far from the mountain whence it originated, it would not
contain coloured mica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270_v2">[270]</span>An incredible
number of potsherds were found below on the flat shore which is
deserted by the river. I thought to pick up pieces of brick, but I
soon discovered that they were fragments of that kind of murhàka
which the Shilluks bake from the mixed mud of the Nile, owing to
the want of stones. I did not discover any remains of villages on
the shore; they appear, however, to lie upon the high gohrs, and
the pools arising therefrom, as if upon the primitive shore. These
gohrs of the Sobàt running parallel, and lying actually twenty feet
higher,—at times, also, displaying higher dams or shores than the
river itself, indicate moreover that the river in its young days
flowed wider than it does now, without deviating from its
direction, so far as I have hitherto observed. I had an opportunity
of convincing myself of what I have stated above, at the village in
the neighbourhood of which I was shooting, and where I saw two
ostriches. Nevertheless these potsherds are testimonies either of a
previous and considerable population of the surrounding country,
and even the hill covered with shrubs above the potsherds might
have supported a village, or that more people dwell above than we
should have supposed; and the pieces of murhàkas may be a sign that
neither stones nor mountains are near at hand, and that the arts
did not flourish; for all these fragments were of rude origin. We
have never discovered traces of any finer vessels of terra-cotta,
or pieces of glass, enamel, or delft ware, such as we find in
Egypt.</p>

<p>When the antelopes come to drink, for which they have room
enough,—for instance, yesterday evening—on the extensive plain,
they appear drawn up as if<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_271_v2">[271]</span> in line of battle, but run away like a
flock of sheep—yet not so close together—as soon as danger
threatens. These animals, so numerous here, might be easily tamed
and fed by the hand of man, if arms did not prevent such
friendship; the lion and hyæna, besides, keep them in constant fear
and trembling, and take a tenth part and more of them, in spite of
all their innocence, as we have seen by the remains of saraffes and
gazelles. Perhaps, the great lord of beasts, with whom I came so
closely in contact that it was only necessary for him to make a
spring, to set his teeth in my bit of Adam’s flesh, had made such a
feast on venison before we met.</p>

<p>It is surprising that I have not hitherto seen any mouse-holes
or mole-hills; the inundation and rains may be the cause of this,
and we have not gone from the river into the interior of the
country. The Schudder-el-Fas (axe-tree, <i>mimosa sensitiva?</i>)
common in Bellet Sudan, is seen on the shore itself,—a shrub
spreading like brambles, with small delicate acacia leaves, a
similar sort of pods, flesh-coloured button-flowers, and barbed
thorns. If its twigs be touched with an axe, or a knife, or merely
knocked with the finger, its leaves immediately close (from fear,
as the Arabs say) as if they were withered. I have not yet been
able to procure ripe seeds of this shrub.</p>

<p>M. Arnaud makes a section, but not where the water running upon
a shallower place allows a more accurate calculation to be made,
but there where the river is full,—namely, in these basins, in
which the water underneath is stagnant, whilst that on the
surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272_v2">[272]</span> moves as
slowly as we have seen the Atbara, which has the very same deep
basins. The public will therefore read of a mighty mass of water,
said to be carried by the Sobàt to the Nile: the breadth of the
river amounts here, as below, to one hundred and thirty mètres.</p>

<p>The section is therefore made, and we proceed at noon. The
strong wind breaks in two the sail-yard of the vessel commanded by
the Arnaut, Mohammed Aga, because Selim Capitan paid no attention
to it, though it was rotten,—and so was the whole vessel.</p>

<p>We land afterwards at our peninsula or sand-bank, where there is
a settlement of six tokuls. The poor inhabitants of these little
straw huts were perhaps those whom Thibaut observed when setting
out from hence, and who covered the whole island like a swarm of
flies; whereupon he slily retreated. I rather think that my
European fellow-travellers are afraid of my being an eyewitness of
their doings and acts, lest I should accuse them of falsehood, or
laugh at them when they exaggerate some small circumstance, or
pretend to have seen wonders, and gone through frightful adventures
with courage: and yet they give all this out of their journals to
their attentive listeners. It is really as good as a play to see
them. Arnaud and Sabatier have separate cabins in the same vessel;
and, as soon as one has gone on deck, ashore, or on board another
vessel, the other tries to find out the hiding-place of his
journal, in order principally to read what is said of him. If
Arnaud abuses Sabatier, the latter gets in a rage; but on our
persuasion rests satisfied with threats, and sits down and writes
against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273_v2">[273]</span> Arnaud
in his journal: then he leaves it carelessly lying about, and goes
away directly Arnaud enters, and the latter, immediately his back
is turned, seizes it and reads it. Thus they read their notes and
diaries in secret, and then I have the pleasure of hearing all
about it from Thibaut and Sabatier, who come on board my bark.</p>

<p>Though Sabatier and Arnaud have related the history of their
hunting two little marafills, the latter has not hesitated to write
down that he came close upon two lions (whereas he only saw two
hyænas running at a distance, whom Sabatier observed at the same
time), because he is jealous, as his countrymen tell me, of my
chivalry with the lion. He describes, also, antelope, lion, and
crocodile hunts with similar Münchausen stories.</p>

<p>Our tokul inhabitants seem to have gained a little confidence,
although they do not shew themselves, for they have tied up a
sucking-calf close to their huts, which Suliman Kashef takes
immediately into his possession. We have here a proof that the
water is still falling, which I had not previously thought: this
was the case in the peninsula to the extent of a foot, and we shall
be obliged to go over the nearest oyster-bank, after we have
remained here half a day, or perhaps the whole, to make the
Arnaut’s vessel again in proper sailing trim. Thermometer 16°, 27°,
29°.</p>

<p>We find here, near the Sobàt, that the impregnation of iron
oxyde, which is frequently so strong, is only in the earth brought
down from above, in all the humus, and also in the coagulated
layers of sand under or between the humus, but not in the drifted
sand. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274_v2">[274]</span>
no trace of it in the clay; it is therefore perhaps a primitive
deposit,—the lime or cement of the ancient world. From this
appearance of iron oxyde, which is not inferior to that on the
upper part of the White river, the Sobàt might provide Bellet Sudàn
and Egypt with iron, if the protecting hobgoblins of the mines be
first driven away. Whether the Sobàt leads to gohrs of gold would
be worth investigation, but the sand of this region has not the
least appearance of it. For that very reason Arnaud is projecting
an immediate expedition up the Sobàt this summer to the gold
sources. Oh enviable Viceroy of Egypt, around whom charlatans of
every kind have drawn a line, within the circle of which no one can
penetrate but Italians of similar calibre, may your eyes be closed
against gold-dust! At noon we set out from our halting-place,
partly with libàhn and partly sailing, glide here and there over
oyster-banks, and soon stick fast again on the sand.</p>

<p><em>25th March.</em>—Sate Mohammed and Sale lay down yesterday
to sleep close by, instead of going to shoot. I felt hungry, and
had not prepared anything: the cook gazed stupidly in the distance;
and I was obliged to eat soft biscuit and drink water. No sooner
had I taken this than I felt unwell, and continued so till this
morning. Thibaut seems to be possessed with the most trivial
jealousy; he cannot understand, like all the rest, what I have to
write so continually. The old monotony of the shores has hitherto
continued. Only this morning two groups of naked Dinkas shewed
themselves on the shores, without running away from us. They
brought even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275_v2">[275]</span>
goats and sheep with them; but we sailed by, and halted at noon
near the dhellèbs, where several groups of fishermen’s huts stood
here and there on the shore. Thermometer 17° to 30°; sunset
28°.</p>

<p><em>26th March.</em>—The wind is favourable; but Arnaud wants to
renew his sections, in order to make the world believe that the
Sobàt gives more water than the White river. He is fishing about,
therefore, in the deep places, and a fall has made its appearance,
which was invisible to other eyes. Yesterday evening I said to him,
accidentally, that I had an attack of fever the day before,
accompanied with vomiting and diarrhœa. He immediately complained
of his health, and said that he was suffering under tertian ague,
and dropped a hint that Khartùm was very unhealthy, in which I
agreed, experience having taught me the same; but I saw clearly
what he meant—he intends to play the invalid, and will certainly
become worse in Khartùm itself, so as to induce the Basha to let
him go to Metemma, where he will find more lucrative work in
examining the ruins there than in composing his map. He eats and
drinks, however, like men in good health—is active on his legs,
even when there is nothing doing—shakes his round head, talks to
himself, lays his finger on his nose, and looks first to the sky
and then to the ground so quickly that his straw hat, adorned as it
is with a large knot of ribbons, in the Tyrolean style, flaps up
and down. A Turkish under-cap and this hat cover his partly bald
head, on which he has let a pigtail grow, to make up for the loss
of his hair at a future time. He stands still, and then sets off
running:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276_v2">[276]</span> we call
him, but his profound meditations will not allow him to answer. The
Turks say, in short, that he is <em>magnuhn</em> (crazed). His
usual expression to the others, “<em>Je le sais tout</em>,” is
worthy of a man of such varied acquirements as he pretends to be;
but he does not dare say so to me. When the time comes that he puts
on the appearance of sickness, he orders Thibaut to be summoned,
and makes the latter understand, if he does not perceive directly
the illness of his lord and master, that he is unwell, and not
inclined for work, and therefore wants to have a little chat with
him. Thibaut sits down very quietly, yawns now and then, and
answers “<em>Oui Monsieur</em>” to all his remarks, and thus are
the rays of these great minds reflected. But Arnaud truly is an
all-comprehensive genius! After he has spoken a little about the
way to make money, &amp;c., it pleases him to fall into a kind of
somnambulism, which will be attributed subsequently to feverish
delirium—talks some hodgepodge about constellations and declining
spheres, which he means, however, to put in order, and then all at
once turns the conversation from stars to his property in the moon,
or to a royal princess, whose favours he has refused—all in most
beautiful harmony with what he tries, at other times, to impose on
the world. During all this scene Sabatier sits in his cabin, and is
nearly bursting with laughter. “<em>Relata refero</em>.”</p>

<p>We navigate part of to-day with a good wind, and may, therefore,
easily reach the Nile. The more I ascend the Sobàt, the more I am
convinced how the shore and land fall away towards the Nile; and
yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277_v2">[277]</span> the former
appeared to me high at first, without, however, being much higher;
but then we came from the Nile, which is shoreless. The Sobàt on
the tract navigated by us is like the shore of the Nile near
Kàhira, and the more ancient high shores in Nubia. The greater
gradation of its shores at a distance indicate a chain of mountains
in the neighbourhood, or an unusually strong falling away of the
slope in the highlands, which is certainly not far distant.</p>

<p>That the Sobàt should still retain its old channel when on the
point of discharging itself into the Nile, as it seems to do at the
upper part, is very improbable, because I saw to-day from the deck
merely a gohr on its left side, at the end of the forest above, and
perhaps flowing into it as usual at high water. Moreover, the
alluvial soil at the lower end of the Sobàt was contrary to the
nature of such soft deposits, and very certainly belonged to that
which I have considered a Nile lake, the reach of which might
always elevate the Sobàt sufficiently high. The undulating ground
extending from the river, and running parallel to it, displays
still furrows caused by the marshes having ebbed away, and the
Sobàt, rushing over it afterwards, flowed without opposition
wherever it liked, and might even have separated into several
arms.</p>

<p><em>27th March.</em>—Yesterday afternoon we arrived at the mouth
of the Sobàt, and remain here to-day to make observations; but if
the strong north wind do not change, we shall not be able to
advance. Yesterday evening another man was carried dead from our
vessel, who would not eat, and drank nothing but<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_278_v2">[278]</span> water from the Sobàt. A
species of marsh hyacinth, having scent, was found by Thibaut. It
has little bulbs, but spreads and increases by shoots from the
root. Arnaud, who is never at a loss for a name, declares that a
beautiful water-bird, with perfect web feet, which we remark, is
the Phœnix.</p>

<p>The Shilluks came this morning from the opposite shore, and
asked us to barter with them. This afternoon a Sheikh came to us
(unless he was an impostor, as the one on our ascent was) and
invited us to come <em>without fear</em> to their city, which was
close at hand, and said that cows, poultry, &amp;c. would be
brought to us. He himself presented us a cow, for which we gave him
a ferda. At four o’clock we were able to proceed with oars: we
navigate to E. and E.N.E. The shores are surprisingly elevated
since we were here, and a considerable drainage of water, probably
the last one, seems especially to have taken place within these few
days. The Nile is not broader here than the Sobàt. Dry grass-reeds
at the right; large hillocks of decayed ant-castles at the left.
Five o’clock, N.E.; the foot of an island on the left, behind which
the river becomes broad, and a group of Shilluks are stationed
there on the ground, whilst further below they have taken
possession of the ant-hills, and stand in the form of a pyramid.
The Turks are dreadfully afraid of these people, and say that they
are “batalin” (bad), because they are aware that the Shilluks know
them well. Feïzulla Capitan has had a number of cartridges made for
his pistols, and Selim Capitan wears his thick white woollen
trousers, and not without cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279_v2">[279]</span>Soon after
five o’clock we stop, conformably to the wisdom of our high
dignitaries, at the uninhabited right shore, which is considerably
higher than the left, and belongs to the country of the Dinkas,
whilst the Shilluks appear to possess the mouth of the Sobàt,
although not protected by forts and guns. Suliman Kashef was
pursued a few days ago by a lion, notwithstanding he had four
halberdiers with him, but he happily escaped the danger. To shew
his gratitude to Allah, he gave every one of his crew twenty-five
piasters.</p>

<p><em>28th March.</em>—We navigated to the neighbouring island,
and passed by it on the left, N.E. by N., just as the sun was
rising. Where is the meat that was to be put to-day into the
Egyptian flesh-pots? The Shilluks will be delighted at having
tricked the Turks, for they are really an extremely vitiated
people. According to nature, corruption of morals cannot take place
in the very earliest stage of life, and there might have been,
therefore, a previous cultivation here which has now disappeared,
and left only the bad parts behind. But how could they have gone
back to the naked state? Slight clothing is even necessary here: a
people that has once worn a fig-leaf never<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_281_v2">[281]</span> throws it off, although a cynic here and
there may choose to lead a free dog-life.</p>

<p>We labour with oars, yet all is in vain against the north wind;
the river itself remains on the average N.W. as far as Khartùm.
About nine o’clock we halt at the right shore, and see herds and
villages of the Shilluks opposite to us; but we must make our
appetites disappear again—“<em>Quid juvat adspectus, si non
conceditur usus!</em>” Really it was very vexatious; and in
addition thereto, the new moon has appeared for the last two days,
and yet my bold countryman whistles and roars, which is so very
unusual at this time that we conclude the same phenomena is taking
place on the Nile.</p>

<p>It has been considered as a thing decided that the periodical
north winds blow the rain from the Mediterranean Sea against the
mountain terrace of Habesh. But these are winds which blow also on
the Western Ocean, along the coast of Africa, and find no
opposition on the sea and further beyond: the periodical gales
cannot ride at anchor so conveniently on the not very high
mountains of Habesh and last until the counter gust from India
ensues, or until the clouds have impregnated all the air of Habesh,
and at last fall, from their weight, and bring refreshing rain to
the country. The Mediterranean Sea seems to me to afford too small
a tract for the sun and wind to be able to draw a mass of water
from it, like that of a small deluge. Therefore, I think that quite
different phenomena lay the foundation of these violent rains, and
that Habesh, beyond the equator, may have its conductors of
moisture from the Indian<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_282_v2">[282]</span> Sea, as well as Egypt by the electrical
course of its Nile. Otherwise Habesh would be enveloped in an
eternal sea of clouds, for the north winds would be bottled up
there half a year, and, by the same argument, the south winds the
other six months.</p>

EAST<br>
27TH JANUARY, 1841.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>According to my views, therefore, the north winds pass over the
mountain of Habesh, which if we take Sennaar, or rather Fazògl, as
ten thousand feet high above the Mediterranean Sea, ought to lie in
analogous elevation, but which assumption, however, does not appear
correct, if we look closely at the mountains of Fazògl. It may be,
then, that the ascent of the ground from the Mediterranean to
Fazògl fills up two-thirds of this height, which may or may not
result from the slight fall of the Nile. General experience teaches
us in Germany, that the west wind, as a rule, brings us too liberal
an allowance of rain. That fountain of ours lies toward the west,
in the ocean: accordingly, the ocean might provide, perhaps, the
valleys of both the Niles and their neighbourhood<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_283_v2">[283]</span> with similar rains, at
periodical winds, the uninterrupted effusion of which during the
hariffs (rainy season) may be derived from other causes, and
perhaps may be sought for in the monsoons.</p>

<p>I found the tokuls of the Shilluks slightly arched: but just now
I see a few higher vaults, somewhat like the Italian cupolas. They
are too high to be called Roman arches. The Romans might have
derived their arch from the sky; the Italians adopt the oblique
form: every part ought to be light, slender, and tending towards
the centre. The tokuls must be considered as the oldest buildings
in Africa. Continual rain necessitated good and secure covering,
and a sheaf, tied at the top, may have suggested the first idea of
a tokul, for the violent showers of rain pierced through the thick
horizontal layers of reeds and straw. Thermometer, 19°, 29°, to
30°; sunset, 28°.</p>

<p><em>29th March.</em>—After the north wind had somewhat abated,
yesterday at noon, we pushed on with oars and the rope, and halted
on the evening at the right shore, near the Dinkas, where a village
was to be seen close above, from which the inhabitants had fled. A
hillock extended along the river, resting on a down of the finest
white sand; and this sandy deposit being covered entirely with
dome-trees, mostly young ones, is perhaps the cause why the river
is not half so broad towards this side as previously. The long
hollow behind the shore, up to the neighbouring old shores,
displays a scanty forest, intersected by two arms of the Nile,
which, for the moment, are stopped up above and below. I found, on
one dam of earth, remains<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_284_v2">[284]</span> of a village that had stood here
previously. Our crew did not lose the opportunity of setting them
on fire, without thinking of sparing the young dome-palms. The
proximity of lions is now alleged as the excuse for the necessity
of fires, although we have seen none since those on the Sobàt,
always excepting the ones described by Arnaud in his journal, whom
he attacked chivalrously, with his Fortunatus-cap.</p>

<p>The direction, yesterday, in which we navigated, deviated more
northerly from N.E., whilst to-day we go N.E. in more easterly
declinations. The north-east wind is therefore against us; but we
are happy at having escaped from the confined talus of the solitary
Sobàt. Our left shore presented us yesterday, and to-day, dhellèbs
and some villages in the most charming situation, two of which I
sketched, and afforded us continually the sight of a green forest,
whilst the right shore displayed only a bare tract and several
villages of the Dinka country, concealed from us previously by the
high reeds. Dinkas and Shilluks hold the points of their broad
spears directed towards the ground, according to the custom of the
nations above, and do not throw them, probably as a sign of their
friendly intentions. The spears are decorated at the extreme end
with a little bit of fur or pelt, which, perhaps, is of the same
use in the javelins as the feathers of arrows among other nations.
The Shilluks and Dinkas have not any bows and arrows; and the
latter weapon, which is entirely without feathers in these regions,
was no longer seen after we passed the Nuèhrs, who dwell up the
river. We halt in the afternoon, firstly, at the shore of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285_v2">[285]</span> Shilluks,
near a little hamlet, close to which is the capital or
residence-village of the Sultan of the Shilluks, whom we had
invited even before we left the Sobàt to honour us with his
presence, so that we might present him with dresses and other
beautiful things. But he preferred to remain where he was, and
perhaps removed further, or intended to send us an usurper of his
name, as he did the last time.</p>

<p>When we landed, inquiries were made for what peculiar reason we
had come there—whether with friendly or hostile intentions; and one
messenger after the other was sent to us, to know whether we wished
peace or war, because Turks had <em>never</em> before presented
themselves in this place. It was no answer to them to say that our
object was merely to navigate and survey the river; and the Mek did
not appear on the scene, still fearing, perhaps, treachery—nay,
even kidnapping. I should like to see, however, the faces of the
<em>good</em> Turks, if the Sultan, who they suppose is afraid of
them as the conquerors of the world, should appear all of a sudden
behind the sunt trees, with a suite of some thousand broad
lances!</p>

<p>Those trees have astonished me by their strength, being about
four feet in diameter, and by their powerful and now shady
branches. The bark of the lower part of the trunk and the stronger
boughs is of a dirty dark-brown colour; and the latter, together
with the smaller branches, are like those of the lindentree. The
small prickles are seen only sparingly on the boughs hanging down,
and the whole present strength of the trees, which have been
deserted by the water since our ascent, seems to lie more in
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286_v2">[286]</span> crisped and
delicate foliage. The grass, which rose previously so luxuriantly
from the water, lies now like a thick layer of straw; it appears to
continue lying on the ground like the couch-grass—yet not in the
proper sense of the word, for its roots are those of grass,—and,
from time to time, to strike root, and also to stand up, if it has
not been kept too long upright by the water, and its slender stalks
have not grown too high. I have remarked this in many places, and
seen both these species at the same time upon the very same root,
the blades having been cropped every now and then, growing crisply,
and standing upright on all sides; it might be, therefore, the
savannah grass, and therefore I secured a specimen of this
grass.</p>

<p>I have not been able to ascertain whence the Shilluks and other
tribes derive the little rice, which is also a species of grass. A
specimen of the fruit is also in my possession; it comes up,
perhaps, like wheat. The Shilluks do not seem to be very much
afraid: they are ready to engage in barter, although they do not
come quite close to us. Perhaps they think to drive us away first,
by not supplying us with meat.</p>

<p><em>30th March.</em>—There was an <em>enlightened</em> assembly
yesterday evening, on board Suliman Kashef’s vessel: all the
lanterns of the Turks were lighted, and were fixed around it. There
is nothing done now without light; we are recalled, therefore, from
the chase by lanterns, even if it be only dusk. I proposed,
yesterday, either to present ourselves <em>in propriâ personâ</em>
to the Mek, at his residence close by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_287_v2">[287]</span> (said to be only two hours distant), or
to receive him in the open air, if he could be persuaded to come,
and not to invite him on board the vessels, according to the
favourite custom, because in that case, he might probably turn
back. They agreed with me, and—there the matter ended. The boats of
the Shilluks exceed in size and solidity those of all the other
tribes. This people also frequently place two trees together, and
bind them together at the bottom by ropes. Their boats have long
peaks, and carry twenty to thirty men, sitting in a line behind one
another. The different colour of the bark of the talles—I had seen
them previously red, and now of a palish green—seems to depend on
the nature of the soil.</p>

<p>The royal cranes, so often mentioned, are in extraordinary
quantities here, and we provide ourselves abundantly with them, but
got very few other birds. They keep together in flocks, and walk
now on the dry old river-bed, which consists of the most fruitful
earth, and extends at two hundred paces distant from the Nile. This
ancient, flat, and choked-up bed of the Nile, being subject to
inundations, is perhaps the place between which and the country
beyond the vigorous forest was planted; for I remarked yesterday,
that the forest stands more under the horizontal line than on the
rising of the shores.</p>

<p>Just now Fadl and Sale came from the Shilluks, some of whom have
encamped at a tolerable distance from the river. I did not
accompany them, because the natives would infallibly have gone away
again, if they had seen a white countenance, as that is connected
in their minds with a Turkaui. A broad<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_288_v2">[288]</span> spear could not be procured from them;
they said that every one had his spear, and ought to keep it:
moreover, they gave my men to understand that their Mek would not
appear until we had also a sultan on board, and that we ourselves
had come to their land as spies. Two of them were tolerably
conversant in the Arabic language, but very few of the others
understood it. One of them possessed a small elephant’s tooth, as
my servants further related, but the glass beads I had given them
were not sufficient to purchase it, nor a sheep. They do not
despise ornaments, and were presented with abundance of white,
thick glass beads (the blue are not esteemed); but they prefer,
however, objects of real value, and wanted, for example, half a
ferda for the sheep. They said that they were frequently visited by
Gelabis (slave-dealers, merchants), and that even the day before
yesterday, they (the Shilluks) had been visited by some of them,
who had come from Khartùm on camels, and brought cotton goods,
ferdas, beads, &amp;c., which they had exchanged for cows, teeth,
honey, simsim, and kurbàks. A cow costs a ferda, and such a piece
of cotton stuff is valued as money, for we never see them clothed
in it.</p>

<p>It is a striking circumstance, that a merchant is esteemed by
them almost a sacred person; however, I would not recommend any
white man to undertake this business here, if he does not wish to
be murdered as a <em>much-beloved</em> Turkaui.</p>

<p><em>31st March.</em>—We leave our landing-place at three
o’clock, without having seen the sultan of one of the largest, if
not the very largest nation of the White<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_289_v2">[289]</span> Nile. Another fellow, however, who came,
pretended to be the Sheikh-el-Bellet (according to him, a son or
relation of the sultan and his envoy), and was presented with
pearls and a piece of calico conformably to the Turkish policy. We
halt for the night at the left shore. A very large number of black
ibes are remarked on the trees: their flesh has a fine flavour.</p>

<p><em>1st April.</em>—Now that I know something of the country of
the Shilluks, which on the whole, perhaps, only amounts to a tract
of shore, the conquest of it, as well as of the land of the Dinkas,
does not appear to me very difficult from this side, even if the
Shilluks were determined to offer real resistance. The army could
defile (that is, in the dry season) along the shores up the stream,
and cover the towing-path, which is necessary here, owing to the
south winds, and the vessels could carry the provisions; there is
no Haba either to fear here, as in Taka. Certainly such an
expedition would be only to press soldiers, or perhaps also to
subdue the whole country; for as to other treasures, they are not
to be acquired, except the large herds, from which the future
tribute might be drawn. If Ahmed Basha, however,—for I have him in
my eye,—could once raise an army of these black devils of Shilluks
and Dinkas, whom he himself allows to possess the greatest courage,
<em>then</em> he might think of other and more profitable
conquests.</p>

<p>That broad, choked-up gohr, of which I spoke previously, seems
to continue, and perhaps does so always with the old high shores,
which, however, may be distant enough. They are now invisible on
both sides, and the new shores are mutually of the same<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_290_v2">[290]</span> height as they have been
for some days. Notwithstanding this, I must still assert that the
Dinka land lies higher than that of the Shilluks, and that both the
barrenness of the former and the dense wood of the country on the
left shore are derived from this cause. On the other hand I have
altered the opinion expressed on the ascent, that we ought to keep
in view only the old or high shores, in composing a map; although
it would be extremely instructive to mark them on the charts, for
the present shores are high enough here at least—about five or six,
and up to ten feet at our landing-place—to be considered as
shores.</p>

<p>We make the bend from N.E. to E., and the Gebl-el-Dinka or
Defafaùngh seems to peep forth down the river before us, but it is
only a delusion. The villages, or rather the long-tailed city of
the Shilluks, Jemmati, Gennap, called by the Arabs therefore
perhaps Dennap, advances with its groups of houses and forest to
the margin of the river, and crowds of people have collected
shortly below our landing-place. We halt at the left shore a little
before sunset, which is at present charmingly decorated with grass
and trees; the former, however, only below on the flat strand.</p>

<p><em>2nd April.</em>—Some Shilluks from the neighbouring village
were on the shore, but drew back a short distance when they saw me
coming. I had experienced a violent perspiration in the night, for
we had yesterday evening 30° Reaumur in our cabin, where not a
breath of air was stirring, and therefore, being in a perspiration,
I had just now thrown over me my burnus, under which certainly a
gun might be very<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_291_v2">[291]</span> easily concealed. The Shilluks are not
generally timid, especially if they be in a body. It were, in
truth, too much to expect that they should prove their courage, in
a small troop and armed merely with shield and spear, against guns
that hit at a distance, and send invisible and inevitable
death.</p>

<p>Their little floating vessels, which we see so frequently
standing against the trees on the shore, serving as fishing-boats,
and also for crossing to the opposite side, consist in the Nile
merely of a bundle of reeds, and have the form of a flat skiff,
obtuse at the stern, because the ambaks are joined together at the
slender end, and tied in three or four layers one over the other to
make the vessel broader behind: there are two holes at the bottom
for the feet. They go quickly, and a long flat oar is used to
propel them along, as in the other boats: their name is generally
with the Arabs, toff, and with the Baràbras, geïhga. The ambak
rafts that come from Sennaar, or Rossères to Khartùm, are large,
and carry a freight of one hundred ardepps of durra. A little wood
approached this morning also on the right to the shore, but having
no trees like that of the left shore. I thought previously that the
Haba of the Shilluks was scanty, but I have altered my opinion by
ocular inspection: the trees must appear thin, even at a short
distance, for the stunted thick stems generally stood in the
water.</p>

<p>Iron is very rare among the Shilluks as in all Bellet Sudan,
notwithstanding the proximity of Kordofàn; and it does not seem
that the kingdom of Bari has ever provided Ethiopia and Egypt with
iron, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292_v2">[292]</span> very
few instruments and arms made of this metal are found among the
antiquities, but, on the contrary, they are of brass and other
metals. The use of iron, however, is very ancient, and perhaps a
black Tubal Cain may have hammered there long before the tribe
accumulated, sufficiently to shew the characteristics of a nation.
If an Ethiopian tribe descended from Bari, it possibly kept up a
communication with the iron country, from the want of iron in
Nubia, though perhaps not by a direct road; or if only a tradition
of iron-mines existed, a Rhamses or some other great king, might
have followed and traced them out; for the White River was just as
accessible as at present, and the vessels of that age would have
found more room for sailing,—that is, supposing a Dædalus had
discovered also sails for Egypt, which we may suppose to be the
case from their sea-voyages, and which is also confirmed by the
hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>It was ascertained yesterday that the Shilluks pasture their
cattle wherever they like. The great inundation of this year has
covered their former pasture-ground with slime, or the water has
retreated so lately that there is not yet sufficient grass, and the
little that has sprung up is already consumed. On account of this
want of grass a large number of Shilluks collected, and armed with
broad spears, drove their cattle from the mouth of the Sobàt down
to this part, and still further to the right shore of the Dinkas.
The latter drew back modestly, and pasture now in the interior,
renouncing Nile fish for the present.</p>

<p>The Shilluks are feared, and particularly because<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_293_v2">[293]</span> they always go in bodies,
and even descend to pasture as far as the Sagiën of Mustapha Bey,
on the left shore. They behave very peaceably, on the whole,
towards us, principally because their Sultan has ordered them to
avoid giving any cause for strife, and to leave the <em>good</em>
Turks in peace. Yet the latter are still in great fear, and Selim
Capitan is very unwilling to pass the night on the left shore, so
we anchor afterwards in the river. We hear in this country, as in
Taka, the greeting of “Habàbä.”</p>

<p>I have convinced myself to-day that the villages visible from
the Nile, standing, as I thought previously, on the old shore—that
is, from the southern part of the Shilluk land down the river till
sunset to-day—do not stand higher than the present shore, and that,
if they appeared to me to lie higher, it arises from the low region
extending behind the shore on both sides of the river, and covered
with water. Every village, however, here lies somewhat high, for
the ground is elevated by itself, through the decay of the old
buildings, and the erection of new ones upon them; or this has been
done by the foresight of the inhabitants, as we have also remarked.
We remain to-day at the right shore; but not any of the people of
the country are to be seen. Thermometer 19°, 30° to 31°, 29°.</p>

<p><em>3rd April.</em>—We navigated this morning to N., with a few
deviations to N.N.W., and halted at noon, by reason of the strong
wind. Then we went on to N., and in a bend to W., where a long road
stretched before us. Now, in the afternoon, we sail, and shall
navigate longer, perhaps, than usual, for the Turks<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_294_v2">[294]</span> are hastening to Khartùm
and its pleasures. The right shore has some trees here and there.
The forest on the left sometimes comes to the shore, and sometimes
level alluvial land separates it from us.</p>

<p>Sabatier and I ate with great <em>goût</em> to-day, on Thibaut’s
vessel, two of the three geese we procured yesterday; but Thibaut
had nothing new to shew us, except a soffeia (funnel for Merissa),
brought from Bari. The people there manage to console themselves
for the want of wine with their African mum, made from durra, as
they do in other places with mead and beer. We stop after sunset at
the Dinka shore, W.N.W., near some trees. Thermometer 18° (cold
north-east wind), 29°, and 28°.</p>

<p><em>4th April.</em>—To-day again the wind is contrary. We go
this morning N., with easterly deviations, and in the afternoon
N.E., with a few declinations. There are several villages on the
left shore; we halt at the right, and the Shilluks retreat. Suliman
Kashef confirms to day what I had already heard, viz., that the
Shilluks worship a tree. They call it by the general name of
Nigàma, which is said to have been introduced by the Great Sheikh,
their ancestor, the founder of their union as a tribe, the father
of the nation, and their law-giver. Almost every village has such a
Nigàma, which is generally a sunt-tree. The place round it is
enclosed, and the ground is kept very clear. On any misfortune
occurring, the Shilluks throw themselves on their face, under the
tree, and call and cry for assistance. It is considered identical
with the holy founder of their race. Whether he ordered them to act
in counsel after his death<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_295_v2">[295]</span> under a tree, and to complain to him; or
appointed the tree as a mediator, through which they might converse
with him; or, lastly, he may have been buried under such a tree,
which thus became an object of veneration; and subordinate Nigàmas
spread then with the increase of population. Moreover, the holy
circuit of the Nigàma affords an asylum even to the enemy, and also
to snakes, toads, and other animals, which are even considered
sacred during their abode there, and fed with milk. A similar
canonization of rats and mice is represented in the Egyptian
temples. The Shilluks hang cows’ tails, tufts of hair, &amp;c., on
the Nigàmas, as sacrifices.</p>

<p>The germ of gratitude is undeniably planted in the heart of
human beings, as in that of animals; and the man of nature who does
not enter into more abstruse speculations will not destroy what
does good to him, but, on the contrary, foster and cherish it; then
comes love, and gradually veneration is paid to it. Idolatry,
though often made absurd and laughable enough by superstition and
individual notions, may have arisen originally from natural
instinct, and is, perhaps, spread throughout all the countries on
the Nile, though we have not been able to obtain satisfactory
information on this subject from want of a dragoman, even had he
only been slightly intelligent, and able to comprehend the
questions properly. But this much appears certain, that the object
of veneration among these nations does not dwell high in heaven.
They had no knowledge of the worship of a Supreme Being. Perhaps
their gods stand around them, or walk friendly with them, and eat
out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296_v2">[296]</span> their
cribs. Even beasts, injurious or fatal to man, may receive
gratitude and veneration from them in return for some instance of
magnanimity. Thermometer 20°, 29°, and 28°.</p>

<p><em>5th April.</em>—We have stopped since yesterday at a narrow
and bare island near the Shilluks, to make astronomical
observations, and shall probably remain here to-day. It would
delight an astronomer to gaze at the stars in these southern
regions, which are never seen in Europe—as for example, the Crozier
of the south, Canopus, which, according to our two learned
astronomers, was even invisible in Alexandria, and had been first
seen by them in Korusko.</p>

<p>Two of my servants have just returned from the Shilluks. I
remarked yesterday and to-day that when the women belonging to the
villages lying not far from the shore, and close to one another,
came to water the herds, with their well made and nearly round
pitchers on their heads, the men accompanied them, spear in hand,
in consequence of the wicked enemy being in the vicinity. The women
did not wear cotton stuff round their hips, but front and back
aprons; and some had a third, a leathern one, without hair, thrown
over the shoulders, or on the back. Man appropriates to himself the
cotton stuff, when luxury goes so far, which is, however, very
rare; yet he must be a chief of a village or a Sheikh, to be able
to wear it, as is the case with the tribes up the river. My men
were not able to purchase a spear or a shield from them. One of the
Shilluks, who spoke Arabic well, declared that they wanted the
spears themselves, and never sold them to Turks; that they were
obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297_v2">[297]</span> to
protect the cattle by weapons, and that by means of these beasts
they purchased their corn, which does not grow in their country
(perhaps in this year owing to the inundation), from which
circumstance they were obliged to eat locusts (geràt). My men were
sent away after this short conversation, during which they were
courteously invited to sit down, as I saw at the distance. We
proceed an hour before sun-rise from our place, but can only make a
short course, in consequence of the wind being contrary, and soon
halt again at the shore of the Shilluks; to-morrow we ought to be
near Mount Defafaùngh. Thermometer sun-rise, 18°; noon to three
o’clock, 30° to 31°; sunset, 29°.</p>

<p><em>6th April.</em>—Still a contrary wind; the direction N.E.,
with easterly deviations. We saw a scanty forest on the right, but
not any habitation,—mostly alluvial soil, which previously stood
under water, even between the trees. When we set foot on such a
ground as this, we cannot imagine from whence the reeds, partly
burnt away, have sprung. The straw in wads covers the ground here
and there, and solitary reed-stalks, the leaves of which seem
blasted by the sun and wind; yet there are still tracts with reeds
on wet soil: also some groups of reed or long straw huts, like
beehives, stand on the left shore. In the afternoon we observe
several birds, and the longing after meat drives the vessels of our
General and Admiral to the right shore, where copsewood and
isolated trees display themselves. Some of our party went off to
shoot guinea fowls.</p>

<p><em>7th April.</em>—Set off at an early hour, with a
contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298_v2">[298]</span> though
not a strong, north-east wind, and continued in a north-easterly
direction till some hours after sunrise. I hear the joyful cry of
“Baghàras!” and perceive immediately from the window a dozen of
these mounted herdsmen, who spring forward to the margin of the
shore on the left side of the river, greet, and make signs to us.
To see horses for the first time after several months gave me a
delightful sensation.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, certain, that cultivation has not ascended the
river from hence, for otherwise the useful horse and the camel,
which subsequently became indigenous on the Nile, would not have
been forgotten, being two of the most necessary animals on earth.
Flags and streamers, with the insignia of the Prophet, were hoisted
to welcome the bold horsemen as Mahommedan brothers, and to soften
their hearts. Then begins a barter for butter, milk, and sheep, but
these Anti-Christs are hard to deal with, for they make us pay
dearly for everything; yet they also take glass beads as well as
gold. It is delightful to view these well-known heads, with their
hair twisted back in a tuft. The men in blue shirts carry three or
four lances, holding the longer and stronger one in their hand. The
pretty girls wear a ferda round their hips, and the swelling bosom
is uncovered. A ring decorates their nostrils, as in other regions,
but, on the other hand, they wear long hair, falling in tresses on
their shoulders—an ornament which we have never beheld in the upper
countries. These horsemen, employed as an <em>avant garde</em>
against the Shilluks, whom they do not fear in the least, are,
according to Mariàn, a bold stem of the Baghàras from
Kordofal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299_v2">[299]</span> (the
last syllable fluctuates between fal and fan) who call themselves
Abanies. Their Sheikh, who is said to be known to me, is called
“Wood el Mamùd.” I cannot, however, recall his name to my
recollection, although he has been with us in Khartùm.</p>

<p>The first island-park appeared this morning on the left, its
convolvuli in full verdant splendour, and considerably elevated
above the water; another one followed, but the variegated flowers
were absent, and the lower part of the foliage of the hanging
creepers was dry, having been covered longer by the water.</p>

<p>We halted at the left shore to wait for the oxen and sheep which
the Baghàras had promised to bring, but these brothers in Mohammed,
were too well acquainted with our Abu Daoud, Suliman Kashef, who
would have dispensed with any payment, and therefore they did not
shew themselves. “Naas batalin” (bad people) they were called,—and
we navigate in the afternoon further to N.E., and wind to E., where
the isolated Mountain Defafaùngh, hanging over the river, sets me
on tenterhooks of expectation. Here I shall see pyramids and
enormous walls, for the whole rock is said to be formed of burnt
bricks (Top achmer). This might have been, therefore, the halting
point for the archæology of the Ethiopian world. I must set out on
my travels early in the morning and sketch the outlines of its
ruins, even if I catch a fever that may continue several days.</p>

<p><em>8th April.</em>—I was on my feet before daybreak, and woke,
as usual, my men from their heavy sleep; I drank a strengthening
draught of yemen, and set off with Thibaut, Sabatier, and three
servants, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300_v2">[300]</span>
whom carried a goat’s skin, containing water, to the mysterious
mountain which, as the final end of Egyptian or Ethiopian
civilization, the first or last power of human art, may afford so
much <em>éclaircissement</em> to science. Cheerful and brisk—for
the sun had not yet risen—I walked with the ostrich and crane, as I
called Thibaut and Sabatier, on account of their quick strides,
through the Ambak wood, and the long grass of the Savannah-prairie,
which was partly burning under our feet. But soon the depressed
land of an old river, with standing water therein, lay between us
and the foot of Mount Defafaùngh. We perceived by some trees here,
on a level with the shore of the Nile, that the water had risen
four feet high—what a lake, then!—and, therefore, the Ambak was
lying dry, and its root bent and feeble. Arnaud was advancing far
behind us, with the military escort given to us for our protection,
which we thought we could do without. When we saw armed natives at
a little distance from where we stood, my two Frenchmen made a show
of courage, but seemed to me to hide their fear under the cloak of
joking. It would have been disgraceful to stop and wait for Arnaud,
and so one after the other rode upon the shoulders of our strongest
servants, to whom a comrade gave his hand, so that he might not
stick in the clay soil and morass, and we crossed in this manner a
narrow gohr, leaving the little lake and the standing pools at our
left.</p>

<p>On we went through the dried low ground until we arrived, after
walking a mile or so, at the foot of the mountain where the ground
is again elevated, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_301_v2">[301]</span> contains some trees (also dome-palms). I
let the others ascend as if they were running for a wager, and
looked right and left for antiquities, picking up stones with which
the steep path I had struck into was bestudded, whilst the long
grass and low bushes, but still more the projecting rocks, made the
ascent difficult and laborious. Some ledges of rocks encircle the
gable-end like a crown; no human being could have chiselled here,
nor has nature so disposed them in her natural course; I knew the
cause from what I had already seen, and from the specimen I had put
into my fowling-bag; I was standing upon volcanic ground, and
therefore I might expect to see a crater on the top. Reddish ashes
and pieces of lava of similar colour filled the space between the
rocks, the porosity of which, as well as the particles of shining
black little stones, similar to coals and porphyry, convinced me
that they have also undergone a powerful volcanic fire, which has
dried up all the pores; or the entire mountain might have risen
from a subterraneous forge, and poured over itself a thick coating
of lava like liquor from a foaming goblet.</p>

<p>If we go upon the supposition, that it is an independent
volcano, and not merely an elevated volcanic mass, we may easily
recognize in the top an extinct crater, levelled by the fallen
walls of rock, such as we see even now on the eastern side, by lava
and volcanic mud, wherein ants at present wallow, and by the
crumbling fragments of projecting rocks. The summit of this
burnt-out volcano forms an oval terrace from N.W. to S.E.; the
north-eastern part, however, is shelving, but the reservoir of lava
could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302_v2">[302]</span> not be
transplanted here, for some of the breaks of the mountain in that
part, are precipitously disrupt, and there are no signs of a lava
stream below. The porous rocks on the summit, exhibit a kind of
decay, entirely earthy and friable, so that we might believe that
they were once covered with boiling mud. The curved rocks, jutting
out to the south, are smooth, considerably lower than our summit,
and separated from it by a horizontal rocky wall, cleft here and
there, which surrounds the crater at the top, and is not higher on
the side we are than five to ten feet. The flat part of the upper
ring falls away slightly to the west, and no lava stream was to be
seen here. If the great lake so often spoken of by me existed at
one time, its waters never perhaps dashed over the summit of this
Stromboli, which is about four hundred feet high, much as it might
increase by the opened sluices of the high land, and thus be in a
condition to reach the volcanic mountain itself. An immeasurable
circular plain lay now at our feet, in which the Nile extended from
W. to N.; at its side, turned towards us, were several standing
mountain streams, which join the Nile again at the rainy season,
and testify to the changeableness of the course of the river, whose
waters formed at one time a large lake at the foot of this
mountain, and still do so at high water. No city, therefore, could
have stood here, and still less on the little summit of the
mountain, where also not a single fragment speaks in favour of the
previous existence of Tokuls, although the mountain would have
afforded the most splendid building materials to a nation, that had
even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303_v2">[303]</span> only
attained a moderate degree of cultivation. I knew already that we
should find no ruins here, for the so-called ruins were said to
consist of <em>top</em>, or bricks; and the fragments of stone have
a great similarity to bricks, but only at the first superficial
glance. The Turks, however, had taken these stones for bricks, and
their fiery imagination pictured immediately pyramids, fortresses,
and tombs; which assumption appeared more credible to me, because
by embracing it and believing in such an existence, I hoped to be
able to trace out, whether the cultivation of the Ethiopians
travelled up or down the river. After a few glances, however, at
the upper valley of the White Nile, I was soon persuaded, that
Defafaùngh only remained as a <em>ne plus ultra</em>, an
ever-interesting boundary-mark of the cultivated western
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The prospect from the top presented to us some Dinka villages
towards S., and a distant chain of mountains to S.E., and another
to E. These seem also to lie isolated in the immeasurable plain,
from the waters of which they might have stood forth, at one time,
like islands. We saw the dung of hyænas and antelopes; and
thousands of guinea-fowls enticed us to descend by a steep path on
the south-eastern side, where the earlier volcanic phenomena were
seen. I scrambled down, whilst the others were shooting, whom my
huntsmen had followed by spontaneous impulse; twice I aimed and
fired, but my gun flashed in the pan, and I had no more caps. I was
therefore obliged to let the birds, driven up from below by Suliman
Kashef’s Turks, fly round my head, or rise under my feet to the
number of fifty to one hundred<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_304_v2">[304]</span> head, without even being able to kill
them by throwing stones, or treading them to death. I thought
<em>habeat sibi</em>, and wandered over the numberless wild paths,
intersecting one another, between thorns and long straw, to the
nearest reach of the mountain, which is only slightly elevated
towards it in N.E., but of equal height to its base. Up rose a
flock of guinea-fowls here, another covey alighted there; they
jumped up and run on all sides to hide themselves, or flew to the
slopes of the mountain, where they were received by the soldiers
standing above, with a discharge from their terrible weapons, which
perhaps they had never heard before. Some of the birds smelling
powder, who were in the neighbouring copsewood, called the others
in vain to leave the circuit of their hitherto Zion.</p>

<p>In the meantime I had found a solitary fragment of a Burma, red
outside and black inside, made in the same manner as those of the
Shilluks, and I roved about the mountain from S.E. to N., where
several blocks of rock were lying below which had fallen from the
mountain, and seemed to be porous basalt, or tophus (the latter
most likely, from the regularity and fineness of the pores). These
blocks lay scattered far and wide to the east, having sharp corners
like those of a red-brown colour, which stand forth as pilasters
from the west side of the mountain itself. They appear, however, to
have been thrown by violence, rather than rolled to this distance.
These blocks, which formerly covered the mountain here as thick
crusts of lava, and under which still other crusts may lie, are
broken off nearly in a horizontal line<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_305_v2">[305]</span> towards the river, and might, therefore,
together with their clefts, easily suggest the idea of ancient
circular walls or fortifications, to the Arabs and Turks. Perhaps
it is from this cause that the Defafaùngh is called also Berba; for
Birbe means a ruin in Arabic. We found there a cave—perhaps there
are several—formed of stones piled up one over the other, equal in
size to the one at the top on the south-eastern side of the
terrace, and inhabited by wild beasts, as we concluded from the
hyænas’ dung; on the north-eastern side we remarked several holes
and fissures in the rocks, occupied at day by owls, and at night by
the guinea-fowls. We saw the former and heard of the latter from
some Dinkas, after we had assembled under the shade of large
tamarind-trees, on which already there was ripe fruit.</p>

<p>The Dinkas came, laid down their spears at some distance,
greeted us with their “hababa,” and sat by our side in a friendly
manner. No sooner did they see the dead guinea-fowls than they told
us, that they kill them either with stones, or by catching them in
the evening in the holes and cavities of the rocks. They were
presented with some tobacco at their request, contrary to the usual
custom of the Turks, who do not shew such favour to these “Abit.”
They thought the “bumb” (report) of guns was “affiàt” (good and
fine), but they were afraid of it, like all Negroes, and so much so
that it appears laughable to us; but what ideas may they connect
with the simple report, and what species of spirit or devil may
they suppose to be raised in the gun!</p>

<p>There cannot be much worship of trees here, for<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_306_v2">[306]</span> the neighbouring villages
have not any shady trees; although these splendid tamarinds, with a
trunk of five to six feet thick, and dense foliage, to the foot of
which moreover the water reaches, as we see by the foot-prints of
the Hippopotami, which serve me as an arm-chair, certainly deserve
care and gratitude. But there was very little cleanliness at the
place where we were sitting (to be silent of the ground being trod
smooth by men), and the boughs of the trees did not shew any marks
of consecration; there might have been, perhaps, about one thousand
head of black birds sitting on them. We proceeded afterwards along
the dry margin of the lake to the two layers of rocks projecting
from the ground, wherein we recognise basalt, also porous, but
displaying great hardness on breaking off the upper crust. I dare
not decide whether this lake be not an extinct crater choked up by
the Nile, similar to the Laacher See on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Girard, who has examined my specimens, says indeed truly,—“The
mountain is clearly an extinct volcano. It rises probably from a
basaltic plateau, for basalt, olivine, and pyroxene appear on it,
and red-brown porous lava, with large circular hornblende crystals,
as well as dark blue tophus, formed from clear porous scraps of
lava and fine ashes, seem to cover its declivity. The tophus, as
well as the lava, does not contain any vitreous feldspar, yet
pumice stone shews itself under them, but all the products of the
volcano prove that it is only converted basalt.”</p>

<p>Everything was therefore collected here to form a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_307_v2">[307]</span> frontier-fortress; but
perhaps it is reserved for another age to see a new Nigritia
flourishing under the auspices of an enterprising man, who has
money, and will undertake men-hunts. Certainly, by that means, the
whole country would be deprived of the free and independent
negroes; who, notwithstanding their poverty, will not enlist for
gold and silver. They even prefer to remain in the old state, for
they love old customs, even if they have seen or been obliged to
have better ones. One example will suffice for many. Several Dinka
slaves deserted from Fàzogl, who had been made craftsmen, taking
with them all the implements of their trade. They appear, however,
to have done the latter, not on account of the greater usefulness
of such tools, but merely for the sake of the iron, to make spears
or bracelets of it: this, at least, our soldiers and Dinkas
affirmed. Some of the deserters were also shipwrights, but yet we
have never seen a boat, although it would be so useful to them in
their marauding expeditions.</p>

<p>The Dinkas accompanied us now to our ships, bringing milk and
butter with them; but we found that they mix cow’s urine with the
former, which was quite sufficient to disgust us, but not so our
servants. The discovery of the desertion of two Dinkas from my
vessel delayed the continuation of our journey; their village,
parents, and relations were near this mountain. We had a long
parley with their countrymen, who continued faithful for some time,
and would not deliver up the two soldiers. At last, when all the
threats were of no avail, and we had ordered our soldiers to get
their arms ready, some one managed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_308_v2">[308]</span> to entice with a good grace three
sheikhs on board Selim Capitan’s vessel, whom we had shortly before
clothed. We bore off from land, and the poor Dinkas, who were too
few to make war against us, saw themselves compelled to give up
their brothers, who were immediately then laid in irons; because,
according to Turkish custom, these kidnapped men, although they
have not taken the oath of allegiance, are subject to French
military discipline. But it was contrary to Turkish usage to
restore the shiekhs without further extortion, and they would
certainly have been carried to Khartùm, if no Franks had been
present,—who speak, however, frequently in vain. Even the voluntary
slaves were put in chains until they were far distant from their
native country. I begged for mercy for the poor prisoners, but in
vain: we then made a short course and halted, for good reasons not
at the shore of the Dinkas. Thermometer up to 32°.</p>

CONCLUSION.</p>

<p><span class="sc">9th April</span>.—Our direction yesterday was
generally N; to-day N. with deviations to the East. We landed early
at the left shore, near the Baghàras, who received us on all sides
in a friendly manner, and displayed here real hospitality,—with a
little craft and self-interest. The mighty bond of language, race
and religion, knit immediately reciprocal confidence, which begot
eloquence, and lively questions and answers. The herdsmen, part of
whom had handsome physiognomies, surveyed our vessels. Whilst their
horses remained close by, they brought goats and sheep to us,
holding them by a rope, a kurbàk in one hand,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310_v2">[310]</span> and a long lance and three javelins
in the other; and seemed, on the whole, to be a more cultivated and
cleanly people, in spite of their dirty ferdas and kittels, which,
being originally of a white or blue colour, were not strongly
contrasted one with the other. Their countenance was expressive,
with their thick eyebrows and sparkling eyes; the hair being
twisted more or less to the back of the head in a cue, allowed the
beautifully arched forehead to stand out, but it is often difficult
to tell the sex of the young persons.</p>

<p>The women and girls coming to us with milk, butter, and fresh
tamarinds, were free in their movements, joked and laughed, and
sought to sell their wares as dear as they possibly could, which
they exchanged for salt, beads, red pepper, and strings of
ostrich-egg shells. All of them were distinguished by a slender
shape, a bold carriage, and pleasing form of countenance; some,
according to my idea, might be called really beautiful, and they
were generally excellently proportioned; they appeared to me like
independent, dark Spartan women. A ferda was slung over the
invisible rahàt being used at other times to cover their heads as a
protection against the sun; the hair was parted, and arranged in
tasteful, little plaits in different directions, or falling down
over the shoulders. Red, and other coloured pieces of coral, were
placed on each side of the head in an oval form; in which copper,
silver, or gold rings were entwined, and even the ear-rings with
their pretty elongation of corals and small conchglia were fastened
to the temples by the shining black<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_311_v2">[311]</span> tresses of hair falling over the
forehead. This head-dress could not fail of making an agreeable
impression upon me, when I thought of the shaven and dishevelled
heads of the women in the countries up the river; the unseemly
custom of wearing rings in the nostrils was scarcely unpleasing
here, from this <em>supposed</em> ornament being so small. They
wore brilliant cut agates or flints of the desert round their neck
and across the shoulder and breast,—the younger girls also over the
rahàt and on the wrists, which they buy from the Dinkas, as well as
corals of different kinds.</p>

<p>On all sides people were advancing slowly towards us, and a
regular market was soon formed; but it was only with a great deal
of difficulty that I procured a bad javelin. The Arabs said that it
would be disgraceful for them to sell their weapons as they were
continually at war. These Baghàras are also from Kordofàn, of the
race of Selim, and of unmixed blood, for they never marry into any
other tribe: whence the difference between them and our radically
ugly crew. From time to time they pay tribute, but properly
speaking, it is a <em>don gratuit</em>. They told us that they
would now cross over to the Jengähs (they call the Dinkas Jengähs,
although the latter are a different people, and dwell above the
Shilluks), since we (their Mohammedan brothers) had visited these
regions, but asked accidentally whether so many Shilluks dwelt
above, as was reported. They also said that there were a few of the
latter nation here, who had retreated at their arrival on the
island, and that there was nothing to fear since<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_312_v2">[312]</span> the death of the Sheikh of
the Shilluks, Abdurachmàn. They thought themselves already in
possession of the whole country. The Baghàras left us after sunset,
but afterwards partly returned to bring more milk and sheep (for a
sheep, one ferda, for a goat about an okka of salt). Thermometer
18°, 29°, 32°.</p>

<p><em>10th April.</em>—We sail a little with a south-east wind in
a north direction with easterly declinations till noon, then it
becomes calm and we navigate. Subsequently, with a north-east wind,
almost universally to N. and even westerly declinations, until we
halt at an island by the shore of the Shilluks. Thermometer 22°,
32°, 30°.</p>

<p><em>11th April.</em>—It is a faint south-west wind, but we are
able to sail; the direction is first N. with easterly deviations,
then westerly, and even N.W. by N. until we to go N., where an
immeasurable course extends before us. Easterly deviations follow
in the afternoon, and the mountain with two peaks seen from the
mast before noon, shews itself in N. The river gains a majestic
breadth for the short track it is free of islands; the anterior
part of the shores is low and bordered with grass. Nile buffaloes
which are in incredible numbers here, owing to the grass on the
islands, greeted us twice to-day, and with such blows that Rassulla
Effendi became quite pale. The tailor-captain is not with us; he
has fallen out with Rassulla about a sheep, and was the more
desirous for a quarrel, because Suliman Kashef presented to him a
loaf of sugar, and he therefore does not want the help of Rassulla
to eat Helluh. However, we are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_313_v2">[313]</span> lucky, for the hippopotami have vented
their just anger on the strongest point of our vessel.</p>

<p>“Look! there is a dead hippopotamus in the water, and men near
it,” was the cry subsequently, but we soon found the difference
when we came closer. It was a boat or raft of ambak just pushed
into the water and on it some men, whilst others were advancing
from the copsewood. Ten Baghàras with lance and shield following
out their old system of plunder, had wanted to play the freebooter
here among the Dinkas, but were obliged to retreat without having
accomplished their object. They found themselves now in the
greatest dilemma, for the water was shallow and they were pursued
by the Dinkas, of whom we counted from twenty-five to thirty.
Suliman Kashef, who sailed a-head of us, ordered a couple of shots
to be fired over the heads of the Dinkas, whereupon they retreated
a little. The vessel, however, could not take up the Baghàras, on
account of the shallow water; they shouted to us to fire once more,
but in vain, for the tailor sat at his handywork and would give no
orders till Sale discharged one double barrel in the air, which
made the Dinkas stand still and gave the Arabs time to row off. In
a regular pursuit, the former would undoubtedly have got the worst
of it, for they are no swimmers, were without shields, and like the
Shilluks, do not cast their spears from their hands, whilst the
Baghàras carried shields and javelins.</p>

<p>The Dinkas, however, will not be long in paying a return visit
with similar intentions to the Baghàras, and will then bear oval
and round shields similar<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_314_v2">[314]</span> to those of the Shilluks, which they are
accustomed to use in war; the shields of the Baghàras, on the
contrary, are round at the bottom and obtuse at the top.</p>

<p>I saw Dinkas frequently on the shore, and nearly all of them
were in the same peculiar position which we also remarked above,
and on the banks of the entire White River; and which perhaps would
denote a kind of affinity, if the language, form of countenance,
and customs did not prove otherwise. To rest themselves, they place
one foot on the knee whilst standing, and put underneath as a
support their hassaie (club of white wood pointed at the bottom) or
their spear. A dozen of such one-legged persons standing together
is a comical sight enough.</p>

<p>We halted to-day at five o’clock near the left shore to wait for
the vessels at an island on which there were monstrous foot-prints
of hippopotami. Close above our landing-place lay the tolerably
long and wooded island of the deceased Sheikh of the Shilluk
islands, Abdurachmàn (Ab del Rahman), Wolled el Desh. It is called
by the Arabs Telleb, by the Shilluks, however, Afunje; a name that
might bring to our recollection the Funghs,—and here it was where,
as I have already mentioned, the Turks in the Expedition of the
year 1839, were not ashamed to open the grave of the Sheikh in
order to convince themselves that the sworn enemy of themselves and
the Baghàras was really dead. It can easily be inferred what a
prejudicial impression such an act must have left behind in the
minds of the Island-Shilluks. Thermometer 23°, 32°, 30°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315_v2">[315]</span><em>12th
April.</em>—We sail N. with easterly deviations; then at noon
towards N., close to a mountain group called by the Dinkas and
Baghàras Njemati, and it is only with considerable difficulty that
we can find a landing-place on the flat shore below the rocks
extending in the river, and when we do so we encamp at some
distance from it.</p>

<p>Thus many islands have retreated at our side which rejoiced the
heart previously with their soft verdure, their flowers, creepers,
and trees, or their blades of grass shooting from the majestic
stream, whilst the water retreated into the forests of both the
shores, and afforded many an interesting picture. Now it is no
longer so, the vessel goes far lower: where the wood does not grow
on the shore, there is only a melancholy low country, and the
cheerful ambak-acacias lie dry on the ground bent and dismembered,
throwing out in vain their long shoots with small leaves and
solitary little flowers, on the soil where some moisture still
remains. The hand of destruction has even fallen on the grass and
reeds; sun, animals, and fire have consumed it, leaving merely
miserable remains. It is only at times when the sun is rising, that
the landscape presents a more enlivening aspect.</p>

<p><em>13th April.</em>—We shall stop here in the neighbourhood of
the mountain till noon. Notwithstanding the heat, I had not any
rest till I made yesterday a trip to the mountain, which I always
thought must be the real Defafaùngh. I had already seen by the
rounded rocks in the river what kind of stone I might expect to
find. A layer of gravel extends to the north from<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_316_v2">[316]</span> these rocks, and I soon
came upon large stones of coarse-grained granite, inclined to a
reddish colour, among numerous little marble stones, which I had
not hitherto seen. A species of shrub-acacia covered the whole side
of the path I had taken under the mountain where the gravel ceased,
of which some bushes served me as a shady resting-place. Its leaves
had already fallen, its bark was green, and it had short arcuate
thorns. The immense number of seed-husks is a proof of the quantity
of flowers it bore; they hung altogether in clusters, and I filled
my pockets full with them. I saw a quantity of guinea-fowls on a
rock running obliquely to the base:—the rocks of the lower
mountains are not perhaps more than a quarter of an hour from the
water. They became very active when they remarked us, and I
ordered, therefore, my dark, half-naked, huntsman to go first, for
these are more accustomed to such a sight.</p>

<p>I had roused a herd of gazelles standing at my left, but
permitted them to withdraw in peace; for I had just found two
little hills consisting of stones of inconsiderable size, evidently
thrown together here. Judging from the analogy of the stone hills I
had seen in Kassela, and being fully persuaded that no violent
rains from the mountains above, or flood from the Nile, could have
so placed them, I took them to be ancient tombs, and searched for
potsherds and other memorials of buildings that might have stood
here, but in vain. Negro villages and cities disappear the moment
they are not inhabited, like ignited bundles of straw, and the
ashes do not remain on the ground. Yet it is not likely that there
were many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317_v2">[317]</span>
inhabited places here, for the unprotected man of nature does not
make his residence near the rocky encampments and cavities of wild
beasts, and no fragments here indicated the contrary. The native of
a civilised country must forget all analogies of his own land, if
he wish to comprehend the meaning, custom, and possible conduct of
a rude nation.</p>

<p>I ascended with ease the nearest fundament of the granite rock.
The rain and distilling sun had produced several round holes, which
appeared to have been chiselled by the hand of man, and which may
frequently blow up these firm masses of stone, as if a mine were
sprung underneath, when they happen to fall on a vein. I found
these holes principally in those places where the rocks presented a
flat, horizontal superfices, as I had remarked also previously in
the granite mountains of the Land of the Troglodytes.</p>

<p>My huntsman—whom, however, I could not see—shot close to me, and
a covey of guinea-fowls rose from behind the next block of stone,
and induced me to mount in pursuit of them. I took off my shoes,
and it was like walking on a red-hot oven, notwithstanding I kept
on my stockings. As we ascend to the summit of this mountain-group,
a dreadful destruction and piling of rocks one over the other is
observed, similar to the scene on the rocks near Phile. Granite
rocks, originally lying above the level of the waters, are rounded
on the top into the form of pikes, cupolas, and horns. Periodical
rains and a hot sun may split, rend, and break them, though only as
an exception to the general rule, as I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_318_v2">[318]</span> believe from the analogy of the Alps,
the mountains on the Nile, and in the desert and country of Taka;
they throw off, therefore, perhaps, their decayed covering, and
burst forth new like an egg from the shell; and, although the
layers on the side of the wind, rain, and sun, admit of no
regularity of form, yet they seldom display any ghastly splits or
gaps. I would assume, therefore, that these rocks also stood at one
time as crags above or beneath the water, in which opinion I am
supported by the rounded gravel visible here and there on the
layers of rocks. I cannot certainly determine in what manner the
granite rocks, projecting here into the Nile, and extending into
the river bed as far as the mountains of Kordofàn, and connected
with the distant mountain visible on the other side, in N. and S.E.
from the mountains here, may prevent at some future times the
waters of the lake from being drawn off.</p>

<p>I was now on the summit, where I found a human skull, and felt
myself very tired, whilst evening was coming on. In order to
descend by another path, I slid down, disregardless of hurting my
<em>posteriora</em>, laying my gun on my knees, and tying two
guinea-fowls I had shot round my neck; and it was fortunate for me
I did so, or else the back of my head would have been stove in. I
met one of Suliman Kashef’s soldiers on the lower declivity, who
pointed out to me wild buffaloes and elephants at a distance, close
to whom he had been. We had seen already a very large quantity of
elephants’ dung. I had lost my huntsman in the rocks: he brought
fowls also, but trembled dreadfully, because, just as he was aiming
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319_v2">[319]</span> the herds, a
lion had presented himself at a short distance. The presence of
lions was subsequently doubted; but this morning my two other
servants took quite a young lion in their hands, to bring him to
me; but they thought it more advisable afterwards to let him bask
on in the sun. They, as well as several others, remarked also wild
buffaloes and boars (Jalùff) in the neighbourhood; and they brought
me, as a proof of the former animals being present here, a horn
quite fresh, the owner of which, had become the prey of lions; for
the marafill (the spotted hyæna), whose calcareous dung is visible
in all parts of this region, never attacks buffaloes.</p>

<p>I repaired now to the foot of the next mountain-group, and was
soon convinced that it was of the same species of stone; however,
to be quite sure, I had pieces or specimens of stone brought me
from the highest peak, and my servants have confirmed me in my
opinion, that there are only two mountains, although Arnaud asserts
that he has seen sixteen, without putting on magnifying glasses.
Some of these specimens consist of pink feldspar, white albin, grey
quartz, and black mica; others of dark red feldspar, but without
albin, with white quartz and black mica.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon Suliman Kashef on my way back, who had collected
his halberdiers around him, and was enthroned on a rock where he
could be seen at a distance. He set out this afternoon to make
observations, which he might have done yesterday evening. The heat
is very great, and I bathe for the first time since a long while,
having left it off<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_320_v2">[320]</span> from fear of catching fever. The
Frenchmen think that they shew great courage by going into the
water; but it is always full of men the whole day long, and no
accident has happened from the crocodiles. My men had not shot any
of the gazelles that appeared near the rocks, to take a hasty
draught; the Baghàras, however, paid us a visit, and brought sheep;
they thought that we were come to make war in their favour, yet no
Dinkas dwell near here, but more up the river. Thermometer 27·30°;
32·31°.</p>

<p><em>14th April.</em>—This morning we proceed at last with a
favourable south-east wind to north, with easterly deviations; but
we soon came to a flat in the Nile, formed by a granite shelf
partly visible, which crosses the river. It is called Gisser—the
same as wall or dam, analogous to Tschellal—and was once perhaps
really a dam and breast-work, of which only the foundations remain.
Who can estimate its future form, and its present ramifications! We
scrape along it a little, but then all went right, and we passed in
the afternoon, N. by W., the very dangerous Machada—el ans, and
Machada Abu Seid mentioned in the ascent, where there was an
eternal grating of the vessels, as if over a gravelly bank: first
we, then the others stuck fast, and the sailors had very
troublesome work. We halted at the left shore, where an incredible
number of monkeys were sitting on the trees. I took my gun, and in
searching through the forest, remarked a she-monkey, among numerous
others, the young one sitting on the lower branches. As soon as she
perceived us, she sprang quickly to her young, took it under her
arm, and set herself on the highest bough<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_321_v2">[321]</span> of the tree. Who could shoot at the
mother for the sake of getting the young? There was another
monkey-like animal there which can only be taken at night; I forget
the name of it.</p>

<p>An arm of the Nile, the ends of which are now closed, appeared
to be a favourite pond of the gazelles, though not one of them fell
to our lot.</p>

<p>The inundation rises through the entire forest, the earth is
cracked far and wide, and not a spike of grass is to be seen under
the sunt, of which the forest of the Shilluks consists, with few
exceptions. But there lay a number of broken off branches and dead
trees, that had not attained their proper age, because, when there
is too much water, the trees stand too thickly, and their tops get
lashed together, and these sunts, especially, spreading from top to
bottom with short boughs, leave no draught, so that the centre of
them is deprived of the necessary air. We remark, however, where
the forest is sufficiently thin, a number of trees thrown down and
withered, especially where the shores lie lower, and where,
therefore, the ground can be scarcely dry at any time of the year.
This may proceed perhaps from wind, for though the latter is not so
violent as to tear up trees from the root, like our northern
storms, yet the tender nourishing fibres are injured or torn off by
the continual motion of the trees, which must be followed by a
stretching and straining of the roots. The tree stands, pines away,
and falls, as we have remarked previously in the country of
Taka.</p>

<p>Suliman Kashef related, with an important air, that he shot
quite close to a large hippopotamus several<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_322_v2">[322]</span> times yesterday evening, without the
beast moving, until, at last, it slowly walked into the river. This
Nile buffalo was said to be a Scheïtan, and Selim Capitan believed
the very same thing. I threw in a hint that Mohammed Ali might have
assumed this form, in order to see what good the expedition was
doing—whereupon there was <em>altum silentium</em>! Thermometer,
22° 32° to 33°.</p>

<p><em>15th April.</em>—Between N. and N.W. The nearest shores are
low, and even where the forest extends to them, they are but
slightly elevated, and the overthrown trees present a melancholy
appearance here instead of the cheerful underwood. The old shores
of the river are visible right and left through the downs of the
forest, and are really high shores, without any deception, for the
vessel goes considerably lower during our present return voyage,
and no illusion takes place, as is the case with the slight
elevation in the extensive plain, which always appears to the eye
to be ascending. We navigate on the broad stream as if in the
forest, woody islands on the right, the same on the left, but sunt,
always sunt, with its melancholy foliage,—my heart longs for
beeches and oaks and their shady halls! It is only on the shore
where winds and water take effect above and below, that we see
trees completely uprooted. The high water has no power towards the
interior of the shore, but another evil spirit, the Habùb (storm),
throws down and scatters boughs and trees.</p>

<p>The north-west wind is against us; we go therefore over N.
easterly to N.E. These windings depend principally on how we sail
round the islands. The<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_323_v2">[323]</span> main direction of the stream is, and
remains from the present, N., with slight deviations to E. and W.
The shores encompassing the long island-sound, are generally
invisible; an accurate map, therefore, could be only drawn up by a
longer stay here.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we halt for a moment at the right shore, and
near the large island of Aba, and hear from the Hassaniës and
people of El Aes that a large hippopotamus had been struck by three
harpoons close at hand. We navigate, therefore, to the left, at the
island of El Gamùss, which has its name partly from the number of
Nile buffaloes taking up their abode in their neighbourhood; and we
see, at its head, the mighty snorting beast half out of water; but
he soon, however, drew back, and swam into the Nile arm, between
the island and the left shore. The sàndal was towed near him, and
after the sürtuk had twice upset, yet without confounding the
experienced swimmers, and the beast had tried in vain to escape, it
occurred to our men, as the hippopotamus was obliged from want of
breath to come up constantly to the surface, to fasten the
towing-rope to the three harpoon, and thus to drag him ashore like
a vessel. Before, however, they got so far, the beast collected his
last strength, and shortly before arriving at the shore, sprung up
with such force that several of the heroes jumped back. I thought
that I should see a national hunt, and the hippopotamus killed with
the spear; but the Turks did not wait for him to gain <em>terra
firma</em>, but shot at him where he was, half out of water, and
certainly, had he landed, he might have trod several men under his
feet, and torn them with his respectable tusks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324_v2">[324]</span>Nine shots
were fired one after the other, Suliman Kashef’s was the last, and
it hit the animal behind the ear: the blood spouted up, and the
monster fell, slain by man’s art, not by his courage. We had him
dragged by the tow-rope of the sàndal to our landing-place, and I
then found that the balls had pierced his neck and back, which
might well happen, when we consider that the distance was only
fifteen paces and that the beast had a fat hide, with no other
shield than the yielding rumples, extending crossways over the
back. The inside of the holes perforated by the bullets, felt like
the body of a fat hog. The monster might be even compared in his
clumsy form to a small elephant, and both correspond just as little
as the crocodile, to our usual ideas of beauty in animals, which
are generally reduced to the standard of the noble horse. The skin
of the hippopotamus displays a dirty pink hue, from the back to the
belly, and the dark green of the upper part of the body runs into
this other colour. The skin, in drying, changes to a dark grey.</p>

<p>The soil of the island, excellent in other respects, is torn up
by the inundation, ascending several feet over it; but many trees
are lying withered and parched up on the ground. I took a specimen
of the seeds of a dwarf acacia, with barbs: I observed also
guinea-fowls and monkeys: the last are said to swim.</p>

<p>Sabatier, who compares the shores of the Nile here to those of
the Mississippi, only that on the latter the trees are higher, is
going to accompany me, in Thibaut’s bark to the Aes, whilst M.
Arnaud decides upon preparing to-morrow the skin of the
hippopotamus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325_v2">[325]</span>
which he has bought for two hundred and fifty piasters.</p>

<p><em>16th April.</em>—Thibaut has started without us—asleep, as
he afterwards said. We remain under Arnaud’s jurisdiction till the
afternoon, then go libàhn against the north wind, and halt late in
the evening, at the right shore. Thermometer 24°, 34°, to 35°.</p>

<p><em>17th April.</em>—The wind is against us in our course;
forest, islands, downs, mostly with a gentle ascent and shallows,
alternate with my impatience, until at last we reach El Aes in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>El Aes, lying on a sandy down, which ascends and descends with
intermission, is said to be a new place, and is called after a
former sheikh of this name. The present sheikh is denominated
Achmet, and the people appear to be a mixed breed. They do not wish
to have much acquaintance with the Turks, although they are subject
to taxation, which a soldier collects there as Kaimakan.
Thermometer, noon, 33°.</p>

<p><em>18th April.</em>—Long before daybreak we proceeded on our
voyage, without any oxen having been brought to us. At first we
passed by several islands, and then left the island of Gùbescha at
our right; several Sagiën fallen to ruin, and some chains of
buckets being visible on the left shore. The village of Hedjasi
lies in the neighbourhood, but not a person was to be seen,
although we remained there the afternoon; even onions were not to
be got. Suliman Kashef thinks that he is not much beloved here,
which I can very readily believe. Thousands of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_326_v2">[326]</span> camels were being led to water on the
left shore, by the Kabbabish Arabs who come from the interior, and
are said to possess more of these animals than all the other Arabs
put together. This occurs every eight or ten days, and the tribe
take back with them what water they need. Suliman Kashef wanted to
make friends with them, because he saw that they had some cows and
goats; but they trotted off as if a storm were coming on, keeping
themselves in troops like an army, whilst they are said to have
shouted “Abu Daoud!”</p>

<p>The colony of Hedjasi lies in a good situation, and might become
a granary for Kordofàn. The soil is somewhat light; the ground
formerly ascended, which declination might have been gradually
lost, when the terraces were in the act of formation; at present it
is all fallen away.</p>

<p><em>19th April.</em>—After we had navigated the whole night, we
found ourselves this morning in the country called Tura, from
whence various roads lead to Kordofàn. The flat shores are sandy,
and rise, having a bad and meagre growth of trees. On the right and
left are some hills of downs, on which we find reddish pieces of
granite, such as I met with near the Sagiën. Whence this poverty of
humus, for Nature ought to be more fertilizing, as she washes away
sand from the ground first, and then brings the lighter humus just
as we see at the Delta? We saw nothing of the mountain group of
Araskòll, for the vessels go now too low. Suliman Kashef continues
his voyage, whilst Selim Capitan and Arnaud have landed on the left
shore, the latter to seek for gold in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_327_v2">[327]</span> Araskòll. The shores continue in sandy
downs, especially on the right side, but an immeasurable level
plain extends on the left, of which we have an extensive view, by
reason of the shores being scarcely elevated above the water. This
character of the country passes also subsequently to the right
side. The entirely flat margin of the broader part of the stream,
which we sail through with a favourable east wind, following
Suliman Kashef, is not pure sand; yet we observe upon it thin
tracts of underwood standing back a little, and dwarf mimosas.</p>

<p>This part is, as it were, the mouth of the river, and formed, in
ancient times, a shallow lake by the conflux of the White and Blue
streams, as the downs on the right prove, which are in connection
with those at Khartùm, and formed the very same embankment; for the
more violent pressure of the Blue river clearly opposes the broad
stream of the White one, as we see plainly near the island of Tuti,
and perhaps only subsequently broke through the angle of land at
the right side of this island; if it made previously, as the Arabs
believe, a bend from the city of Soba to the west into the White
river, and thus surrounded, with the latter, the desert rocks of
Omdurman lying at the side. An investigation, however, would be
necessary to ascertain this point. The Downs continue again
afterwards at the right shore, alternating even with downs of
earth.</p>

<p>If a shallow lake of such dimensions existed here at one time,
the north wind drove its waves and billows to this side, and piled
up these irregular heights, which are not arranged in a row like a
chain, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328_v2">[328]</span>
sometimes advance, sometimes retreat. The lake withdrew, and the
river levelled, took and gave, so that in many places long tracts
of continuous sandy shores existed, having, however, a fertile
substratum, because otherwise there could not be the vegetation
that there is. This subjacent soil is also frequently visible as
humus or morass, and under it an adhesive blue clay is found, as I
ascertain plainly by the sailors’ poles, which are continually
being pushed into the deep. Thermometer 22° 29° to 30° 28°.</p>

<p><em>20th April.</em>—We halted yesterday at sunset, near the
mandjeras of Khurdshid Basha on the right shore. These docks (there
is a similar one on the blue river at Kamlin) are still used, and
two new ships have just been built, whilst ten barks are in dock
for repairs. The workmen live in the village immediately behind the
high shore of the downs, and I saw, in my excursion there, several
fowls walking cheerfully with a number of turtle-doves in the shade
of the sunt trees, although the people would not sell me a fowl.
There is also a corn magazine here, with overseers and
soldiers.</p>

<p>The neighbouring sheikh and Arabs came to kiss Suliman Kashef’s
hand: he never once looked at them, but went on speaking with the
other Turks. Such conduct, with many other things of the same kind,
is practised deliberately; although it may seem to the
inexperienced only to arise from forgetfulness. In short, the Turks
do everything to make themselves disliked. It is most advisable for
a person who is not dependent on them, to treat them with a certain
kind of indifference, to seat himself immediately<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_329_v2">[329]</span> close to them, stretch his
legs here and there in all possible ways, and ask for a pipe,
without waiting for this favour from the swaggering fools;
otherwise the Jaur or Kaffr will always be neglected and despised
by the Musselmen.</p>

<p>I examined this morning the nature of the downs, and found that
they are rather deposited earthen walls or dikes, fruitful humus
strongly impregnated with shingle or rubbish, (dissolved particles
of stone) and sand. A covering of sand overlays these hills of
earth, being thick, and accumulated by water and wind towards that
part of the river-side which is more broken and washed away. The
hills lose themselves towards the land side, gently descending in a
wide plain (galla) covered with scanty mimosas, which still remain
tolerably elevated above the river and the left shore. We observe
here far beyond the lower trees, a second dam of downs, which may
surpass the former one in height, and perhaps is the old border of
the right side of the Nile.</p>

<p><em>Now</em>, when I see from these heights of downs, which are
sufficiently elevated to enable me to look over a low surface of
earth, the left shore lying level with the water-line itself, I am
no longer surprised at not having found any limits for the border
of the Nile, on our ascent. But it is exactly on this account that
I take it to be impossible, with the present state of the Nile,
that those morass hills (for the constituent parts are and remain
nothing else but morass, mixed and rolled on by other powers than
the present), could be formed, even at the highest water-mark,
under present circumstances. Yet the latter have been
always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330_v2">[330]</span> the same
since the land became dry, and the left shore was still lower than
it is at present. But now the river has full play, and it cannot
therefore rise high, as the appearance of the hills of earth teach
us themselves. If there lay here, however, a shallow lake, through
which the current of the Nile flowed, then morass-hills might have
been formed to the height of the highest water-mark. And this is
what I believe. The Downs still continue for a good tract, and are
lost imperceptibly, again to emerge under the very same
appearance.</p>

<p>Arnaud wants to have the hippopotamus-skin dressed again; it is
extended on the sand, but it diffuses a very bad smell, and he
retains therefore only its head. We must remain here till noon for
the sake of this important business, and because Arnaud
<em>will</em> make observations. Then a somewhat favourable but
faint wind gets up: we navigate henceforth almost N. and N.W. In
the afternoon the piles of earth, thrown up by the waters of the
lake, are visible on the right side of the Nile, similar to those I
have seen in the lake-caldron of Taka.</p>

<p>At dusk reefs are seen in the river: they appear to me to be
limestones, and extend from the granite bank of Syene across the
river from E. to W. At one time they might have carried on their
backs beautiful islands, as the granite reefs also previously seen,
which took the road of the lake, and perhaps settled themselves
again at the Delta. We see that the White River finds opposition
also here, and has found still more, from which its slow current is
confined by itself. We navigate till late at night as far as
Mount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331_v2">[331]</span> Mussa or
Brane, from which I procure specimens of stones of the chert
species, and remain there. Thermometer, 22°, 30° to 33°, 21°.</p>

<p><em>21st April.</em>—We come again before noon to a reef of
rocks running through the river, although the passage remains wide
and broad enough:—then to sluices. The favourable wind does not
last long to day; but the men row diligently, for every one is
hoping to see something dear to him again, like myself, who am
impatient and ardently longing for my beloved brother. Our course
goes mostly between N. and N.N.E., and in the evening, we land near
the trees of Moha Bey, where the last downs appear, whilst the
shore extending flat on the left, supports its old character. I am
thinking of making an excursion afterwards from Khartùm, because by
the direction of the downs I hope to be able to determine something
with respect to the shallow lake of the city.</p>

<p><em>22nd April.</em>—Thibaut wanted to go yesterday evening to
Khartùm, to take the first intelligence of our return, but that was
not allowed. I am obliged also to remain, because I have fallen
among robbers, and have eyes like Argus. The intelligence just
arrives that Soliman Effendi is dead. I am sorry for his family, as
I was for that of Vaissière, intelligence of whose death was
brought to us seven days ago, by an Arabian officer. Soliman
Effendi is said, as I hear now, to have poisoned the young lions I
possessed: but let him rest in peace! The society of Europeans must
and will now take another and better form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332_v2">[332]</span>A number of
people came from Khartùm to pay their respects to our little Basha,
Suliman Kashef, who is lying under the trees on the extended
carpet. I am tired, and almost worn out, for I have not slept the
whole night, because I am expecting every instant to see my
brother, and have been looking, since sunrise, in the direction of
the spires of Khartùm. Thermometer 22° at sunrise.</p>

<p>At first we navigate N. by E., then N.N.E. Oh, for the happy
meeting! a former servant of ours has just come to his brother,
Fadl, and gives me good, but not sufficient, intelligence. We wind
north, near Omdurman, shortly before the mouth of the White river,
where an arm of the Nile runs round the little island on the left,
and rocks in the water on the right lie opposite to those at the
right shore. Here, therefore, the White stream had to break the
last dam, and its current was doubtless under the small chain of
downs of Omdurman. At last we bear up near the rocks from whence
the White river, which was unquestionably pressed through them and
has but a slight breadth here, takes the direction to north for
this short tract. The other vessels are already sailing up the Blue
river, and we navigate very slowly behind with our heavy vessel,
the wind being contrary.</p>

<p>The thunder of cannon rolled down from the vessels—joy and
pleasure. I wished to describe our return, but I did not see my
brother. Black thoughts suddenly shook me as if a fit of ague had
attacked me. When I saw even the window-shutters of our divan
closed, where he might wait for me so comfortably<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_333_v2">[333]</span> in the shade, I trembled
violently, and my knees tottered so that they laid me on the bed. I
soon, however, got up, and sat before the cabin; and just at the
moment when our vessel touched the land, some one pointed him out
standing on the shore. I jumped ashore from the deck, and fell
down: my brother raised me up. Eleven days after this happy meeting
he died in my arms, completely broken by the effects of the
climate.</p>

<hr class="decor spaced2 width4">

<p><span class="sc">Much</span> has been written, advised, and
spoken, concerning the important question of the Geographical
position of the sources of the White Nile, since this voyage of
mine; many ridiculous as well as arrogant conjectures, and bold
assertions, have been laid before the learned world, without any
loss of time, respecting this historical subject. Among the
pretenders to the discovery of the sources, Antoine D’Abbadie
stands out the boldest of the bold. (<em>Vide</em> his letters from
Omokullu in Ethiopia, 5th, 6th, and 7th Aug., 1847, in the
Athenæum, Nos. <span class="sc2">MXLI</span>. and <span class=

Hebdomadaires des séances de l’Academie,” 4th Oct. 1847, No.
<span class="sc2">XIV</span>., T. <span class="sc2">XXV</span>. p.
485-487).</p>

<p>The principal thing of importance for a traveller who starts on
expeditions of this kind, is to see with his <em>own eyes</em>, and
to verify by personal inspection or mental contemplation what he
hears from the Natives; for the <em>solitary</em> traveller may
have <em>everything</em> related to him that he wishes, and, in
fact, seeks to obtain. There are no European companions, and still
less eye-witnesses of the soil of happy Ethiopia, to tax him with
false statements; and how easy is it to find natives who have no
conception of the great importance of their expressions, and are
ready, without any qualm of conscience, to assent to the
preconceived notions of the traveller, when they think by that
means to please him!</p>

<p>M. Antoine D’Abbadie, even previously, had
<em>discovered</em><span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_336_v2">[336]</span> the sources of the White Nile,—as he
wrote in a letter, dated 17th October, 1844, from Adoa (Adwa), in
Habesh, addressed to us in Kàhira. (Preussiche Zeitung, 21st
February, 1845, and others.) That glorious fountain-head was said
to lie <em>then</em> in the land of Gmura, or Gamru, near the
mountains of Bochi, or Dochi. The latitude and longitude of it were
not given. He does not seem to have planted the <em>drapeau
tricolore</em> there, any more than my French companions did at the
final point of our expedition; because, had they done so, both the
Turks and myself would have set up our national standard. For my
part I did not let the opportunity slip of denying the claims of
D’Abbadie to raise a shout of victory at having solved the question
of the sources of the Nile, and to contradict his absurd etymology
of the Mountains of the Moon, upon which the whole discovery was
said to be based. (Monthly Report of the Geographical Society in
Berlin, 7th Annual Vol., p. 20.) He thought that the name of
“Gmura,” or “Gamru,” being analogous in sound to that of the Arabic
language, had induced the Arabian Geographers to adopt this word,
and to form it into the present Kamar (Moon). Mr. Ayrton, to whom I
will afterwards advert, takes the opposite side, and is of opinion
that the former denomination is a corruption of the Arabic word
“Kamar.”</p>

<p>This Nile source of 1844 appears, however, to have been dried up
again, or discarded by M. D’Abbadie, for he suddenly transplanted
the <em>true sources</em> of the White Stream into another country;
the forest of Babia, between Inarya (Enarea,) and Jumma Kaka
(Djimma Kaka); and, <em>to be sure</em>,—between 7° 49′ N. Lat.,
and 34° 48′ E. Long., from Paris. (See his reports and letters of
1847).</p>

<p>I must, however, entirely controvert this second discovery,
notwithstanding it is declared in the most positive manner. Error,
indeed, is natural to man, but truth must assert its<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_337_v2">[337]</span> claims; besides, I do not
deny that M. Antoine D’Abbadie would have liked to have made such a
discovery, or to become an historical discoverer. Far be it from
me, who know what travelling is in Africa,—who suffered the
tortures of its deserts and its scorching heat, and struggled
several times with fever and death, to consider the Tricolour which
he fastened to the trees of the Babia forest as a vane or
weathercock. No: I greet it rather with friendly interest as a
cheerful sign to science and a way-mark to geographical progress,
and as an agreeable surprise to succeeding travellers.</p>

<p>Now D’Abbadie makes <em>his</em> source of the Nile bubble up
about the <em>eighth</em> degree of north latitude; whereas, I have
navigated up the river with this Expedition, which has advanced
further than any other, as far as the <em>fourth</em> degree north
latitude, where, as already mentioned, the sources of the Nile were
expressly pointed out to us as lying still farther to the
<em>South</em>. It appears to me, therefore, a desperate and daring
attempt, on the part of our discoverer, to claim for himself “primo
occupanti,” that water which he saw, or even waded through, as
being <em>a priori</em>, the <em>real and true</em> source of the
White Stream. The pretensions to <em>priority</em> of
discovery,—claims that were to be kept up on any terms,—may perhaps
be what he has fixed his eyes upon, and which he has pursued too
eagerly, without any forbearance, as is plainly perceived by his
passionate letter to Mr. Ayrton, against Dr. Beke, who inclined to
the opinion expressed by me concerning the source. The degree of
latitude stated by him, in complete opposition to the direction of
all the stream territory we visited, is no stumbling-block to him
any more than the diametrically opposite opinion of the natives of
Bari.</p>

<p>Antoine D’Abbadie specifies three points which appear to him to
decide the only true source of every river; it is therefore
surprising that the <em>first</em> of these rules laid down by
him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338_v2">[338]</span> viz. to
determine the course of a river by the <em>opinion of the
people</em>, is exactly inapplicable to the White Nile; for
<em>that</em> is completely in opposition to his favourite idea. He
tells us expressly that the aborigines dwelling at the sources of
<em>his</em> White Nile, make <em>these very same sources</em> flow
collectively into the Abbay (Blue Nile). It required, therefore,
more than courage to throw aside the popular opinion, and to give a
contrary direction to the sources, without having convinced himself
<em>personally</em> of the fact, by a corresponding examination of
these supposed tributaries. This statement of the people of Damot
ought to be more valued and credited, because, according to him,
they derived their origin from Gojam (Godjam), and Bagemidr;
therefore from a northern country on the Abbay.</p>

<p>A nation connected <em>directly</em> with another by
water-roads, as must be the case between the inhabitants of Kafa,
Enarea, and Bari, according to the hypothetical river of D’Abbadie,
ought to have <em>domestic</em> animals, and customs in common, if
only partly so, being under an <em>exactly similar climatic
situation</em>. Enarea and Kafa have coffee, horses, and asses; but
these are entirely unknown in Bari, as I stated in the year 1844
(Allgemeine Preussiche Zeitung, 24th July, 1844). Sheep, poultry,
and leather are said by D’Abbadie <em>not</em> to be in Kafa;
whereas we have found them in Bari. He relates that dollars are
very well known in Kafa, and that the merchants are very eager
after them; but in Bari money is not known, as we convinced
ourselves by enquiry. From this argument, then, the sources of
D’Abbadie and the pretended countries they flow through are not
connected with Bari. Besides, the names of these countries were
<em>never</em> mentioned to us. That the mountain-land, however,
lying to the east of Berri, in the neighbourhood of which the
water-shed might be found, is a principal emporium for these
regions, and that they are connected with the rivers discharging
themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339_v2">[339]</span> into
the Indian Ocean, follows from the facts previously specified, and
even from the indications of the things found there. A slave-market
does not seem, however, to exist; and, in order to attest this
fact, commercial reports alone could prove whether copper also was
brought from the interior of Africa. We may boldly affirm, without
any self-persuasion, that the <em>southerly</em> direction of the
stream can be determined, within a few degrees, from the island of
Tshanker, by the plastic formation of the mountainous region,
through the cleft valleys of which the true White Nile breaks.</p>

<p>The eye may, as it were, follow what we hear from the natives,
who only point towards the south, and assert that they do not know
of any water flowing towards E., where they are, however, in
commercial relation with the country of Berri, ten days’ journey
off; but they only speak of <em>springs</em> found there, which
were translated to us by the Arabic word, “Birr.” We were given to
understand, also, that this land, so rich in copper, was
mountainous; from which I conjectured that there might be brooks
there, especially at the rainy season, but that not one of them
could stand even a remote comparison with their Tubirih (White
Stream at Bari).</p>

<p>So, also, the beautiful fine-grained salt, brought from thence
to Bari, is not the rock-salt of the desert, but is extracted from
the brackish water and slime, according to the form of the vessels
in which it has been boiled. I have seen, however, in the great
tract of country between the lower Atbara and the Red Sea, that a
land subject to tropical rains—although, as in Africa, without
rivers and streams—can provide, even in the dry season, men and
animals with water from its earthly womb—that is, from the torrents
and water-tanks. The Anthropophagi, also living on the
mountain-chain by Logojà, in the neighbourhood of Bari, have not
any running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340_v2">[340]</span>
water; but they take it from the ground: namely, from natural
cisterns or cavities.</p>

<p>We had all believed that the White Stream must come from the
<em>East</em>; therefore our enquiries about that side were more
careful: but not all our signs towards the East could bring back
the Natives from the South, the true source of the Stream. I
remember still quite well that I wrote this down immediately, and
laid it before the Geographical Society, in Berlin, some years
before there was any talk of the various sources described by
D’Abbadie. Moreover, it seems to follow from the whole
configuration of the line of mountains, that Nature has fixed here
a water-shed to the East as well as to the West; for the mountain
chains of Logojà and Kùgelu stretch from East and West to South,
probably as branches of a mighty mountain-stock under the Equator,
from which the streams of the Bach’r-el-Abiad issue.</p>

<p>Although M. d’Arnaud, my companion during the voyage on the
White Stream, says that the latter is navigable for a “cinquante de
milles” from the island of Tshànker, and arbitrarily makes the
<em>main arm</em> of the smaller rivulet of the Nile spring from
the east; yet this is either only the remnant of our old affection
for the <em>easterly</em> descent of the river; or it may be the
result of a want of truthfulness. I challenge Thibaut and Sabatier,
his own countrymen, to come forward and state whether there was
ever any talk about such a main-arm as he describes. According to
Làkono, who had been there, and called the land wherein the source
lies by the name of Anjan, the water in the <em>four</em> brooks,
by the conflux of which the White Nile is formed, reached <em>only
up to the ankles</em>. This land, however, lay to the south, as my
travelling companions must remember, and which Arnaud also allows,
as I will afterwards prove.</p>

<p>Now if we would follow for at least 5° towards the north such a
Nile brook, from this county of Anjan to the Forest of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_341_v2">[341]</span> Babia, in order to be
extraordinarily complaisant to M. d’Abbadie, who might rely upon
Arnaud, we should not find, even with a microscope, the silver
threads of his sources.</p>

<p>Now if I wished to discard the opinion of the people of Bari, as
being contrary to my conviction, like d’Abbadie has done with
respect to the views of the natives, because they were opposite to
his theory, I would not say anything of the rashness of the “Knight
of the Source,” nor envy him the fame which is due to him as an
indefatigable traveller, and the <em>croix d’honneur</em> awarded
to him for this presumed discovery; that is, supposing that the
stream we had before us on the island of Tshanker wound to the
<em>east</em> from the south under the rocks of Lugi and Kalleri
(evidently harbingers of a high mountainous region), and then
flowed humbly under the mountain-chain of Logoja, to seek its
origin from the fourth to about the eighth degree of north
latitude. The river, however, does not accommodate itself to this
course, but steps forth boldly from its rocky gates, as a
mountain-stream. The ascending ground, and the rocks scattered in
the river above the island, shew that the fall must increase
considerably in the mountainous region—as even the rocky wall of
Kàlleri forms a vast waterfall at the rainy season—which might make
us conclude that there is a lake lying high, in which an extensive
mountain plateau pours its waters, or perhaps even serves as a
periodical channel far above the Nile. The greater gradation of the
river-bed, necessarily following its entrance into the rocky
territory, must at last make the Forest of Babia an enormous
height, in a progressive ratio; and the latter, though at a
distance of four to five degrees, must be connected with
mountain-ridges, to lead the stream into a high longitudinal valley
lying to the south, as if into an aqueduct, so that it may not pour
into the vast basin to the west, to which the Sobàt also is
hastening. Without entering point by point into Antoine
d’Abbadie’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342_v2">[342]</span>
accounts, which are not always clear, and the hypothesis of his
defenders, I must assume that he abode not only in Inarya, the
field of his study on the sources, but also in Kafa and Bonga, for
he expressly says so. I can readily believe also, that the
complication of rivers in the Forest of Babia cost him considerable
pains to find out the <em>true</em> source of the White Nile,
against the <em>general and prevailing opinion there</em>;
likewise, that he tried to discover, by means of verbal
expressions, the relative quantity of water of the five
tributaries, because otherwise he must have resided there three or
four years, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now if it be true that the people of Damot have emigrated from
Gojam, the Abbay must be well known to them, because Gros-Damot
lies between water, which partly encompasses Gojam, the Gojab, and
the Didesa. I do not altogether understand how he can reject the
testimony of the people of Damot, on the futile ground that they
descended from Gojam. If this nation now extends up to the summit
of the sources, so must they also know from their primeval
acquaintance with the Abbay, whether their waters pour into the
Abbay or not. Though the exploration of the mouth of the Niger has
also cost much labour and time; and though Dutch simplicity or
craft still makes the Rhine flow into the Waal, yet it is more
natural for a nation dwelling on a river to know in what direction
it flows, than to be able to give the direction of the curves and
windings of its tributaries towards the sources. And is it likely,
that a people whom he calls aborigines, and who must therefore be
acquainted with their home, should not know whether the river runs
towards the south or to the north, in a stream territory with which
they are well acquainted?</p>

<p>The second decision of D’Abbadie, that the larger mass of water
decides a source or a tributary, overthrows entirely his third and
most essential one, viz. that one ought to look<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_343_v2">[343]</span> at the direction of the
river; because, in truth, he has neither followed the latter as far
as the White Nile, nor to the Sobàt, whose sources appear to him a
mere bagatelle. It almost seems as if he chivalrously cut asunder
the Gordian knot of that entanglement of rivers during his
hermitage in Iaka, and has tried to force on us a vague hypothesis
as being the real matter of fact.</p>

<p>There is a strange controversy in the relation of his journey of
discovery, which ought to be sifted closely. He had <em>long</em>
passed over the mountain-chain of Nare, when he took up his abode
in the Forest of Babia, having arrived, as he expressly declares,
from the basin of the Abbay (Blue Nile) into that of the White
Nile; and yet he had, on his right, the sources of the Didesa, a
tributary of the <em>Blue</em> Nile. According to this statement,
he has never issued from the combination of streams of the Blue
Nile, or he has come to a point to which rivers flow, as in
Paradise, from all four corners of the world. All this is not
exactly adapted to make us believe that the river Gojab, or Uma
(Omo), which springs from those sources, is identical with the
<em>White Nile</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Johnston has conceived the strange belief that he
participates in the views of D’Abbadie; but the good man makes his
Gibbee (Durr, Omo) the Gibe and Gojàm of D’Abbadie,
<em>receive</em> at last the waters of the Abi (Abbay), in the
environs of Fàzogl; consequently he has claims with D’Abbadie to
the discovery of the main source of the <em>Blue Nile</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Ayrton also (in the Athenæum, No. <span class=
"sc2">MLXI</span>.), steps into the lists for M. D’Abbadie.
Notwithstanding his learned attempt to fix etymologically the
situation of the source-territory of the Nile by a fortuitous
coincidence of words according to a previous plan of D’Abbadie, I
cannot assent to his views.</p>

<p>If the inhabitants of the coast of the Red Sea first
navigated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344_v2">[344]</span> this
Stream, as naturally would be the case, and the Sabæans, from
Arabia, conquered Habesh in the time of Solomon, the latter colony
might still have remained their principal commercial settlement on
the coast, and even have been planted long before their
immigrations from Asia. The dialect of the Ethiopians, which we
still recognise to belong to the Semitic languages, announces that
there was a communication with these maritime countries before the
period of history: yet, commerce on the coast of Habesh might
perhaps only have remained a coasting-trade; for history hands down
to posterity merely the fact, that the Arabs made journeys to
China, and that the Nabathæans brought Indian goods and asphalt on
their camels to the Egyptian market at the time of Alexander the
Great,—the latter article being fished up from the Red Sea. It is
improbable that the Sabæans, who were very well known under the
successors of Alexander, extended into the Ethiopian highlands
their colonies in Habesh, where even now the Arabic language only
prevails on parts of the coast, in commercial intercourse. It is
very unlikely, also, that they have given the name of “Mountains of
the Moon” to a region; because such a change of a local name, which
was certainly imposed upon that country beforehand, pre-supposes a
regular Sabæan colony on the spot, whose idiom might perhaps be
discovered in a different way than by the solitary word “Gamarö,”
or “Gimirö;” for we might derive this as well from “Gimri,” or
“Gumri,” (turtle-doves), as I have heard also somewhere in the
Desert the name of “Gebel Gimri.” It seems to me, therefore, that
it is rather too daring to wish to identify this
expression,—according to Abbadie, “Gamru,” or “Gmura,” with the
Arabic “Kamar.” But if these parts, so remarkable on account of the
sources of the Nile, had been known in the ancient times, the
Egyptian priests and Herodotus, or most certainly the later Greeks,
would have learned something of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345_v2">[345]</span>The argument
that the illustrious Claudius Ptolemy derived his σεληνης ορος from
the Arabs, appears to me completely untenable. There is no record
existing beyond the time of this geographer that I know of, which
mentions “Gebl Kamar;” if there were, it would be convincing. There
can be no doubt that Ptolemy acquired his information from Egyptian
elephant-hunters, otherwise he would not have transferred the
origin of the sources to the neighbourhood of the Equator. These
elephant-hunts were fitted out like military expeditions by the
kings of Egypt, and penetrated, according to Pliny, far into the
Ethiopian provinces, beyond the Lybian deserts.</p>

<p>I cannot either participate in the views of Mr. Ayrton
respecting the points of culmination of the Ethiopian highlands,
but I assume that there are three independent mountain-chains in
the interior of Africa:—the eastern one in Habesh, the western in
Darfûr, and the southern being the Mountains of the Moon, in Anjan,
near the equator; which place I have mentioned several times in
this discourse. These form also partly the watersheds, as I will
explain more clearly. I also will allow myself here a play upon
words. According to D’Abbadie, the moon is called in Kafa “Agane”
and “Agina,” and the name of my moon-country is “Anjan.” What more
therefore do my African etymologists require? The two countries
cannot lie very far asunder, and the analogy of their languages is
certainly possible, without even consulting Mezzofanti,<a id=
"FNanchor_7v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_7v2" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
but the pronunciation is always difficult to reach. “Angan,”
however, is not the word for moon in Bari. If we wish to retain the
expression of “Mountains of the Moon,” we must go back to a
primitive word of the language of the place, as Dr. Beke thinks
with regard to his “Mono Moezi.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346_v2">[346]</span>Once more I
must return to Freind Arnaud, and his insipid account, for we could
not expect anything else from him, as he did not keep any
descriptive diary wherein he could note down his dreams about
Làkono’s body-guard of women, and things of the same kind; but he
has filled up his journal with lion and elephant hunts, and other
fabulous circumstances, like a pictorial newspaper. He says
(<em>Vide</em> Bulletin de la Société de Géographie deuxième série,
t. xviii. p. 376) that the Nile is navigable from Bari for thirty
hours further, but forms here different arms, the most important of
which comes from the east, and flows past the great country of
Berri, which is fifteen days’ journey towards the east, from the
mountain-chain of Bellenia (Pelenjà). I also am of opinion that the
river, one arm of which, where we lay near the island of Tshànker,
was three hundred metres broad, and afforded only a shallow stream
of about three feet in depth to the vessels, which had become light
by reason of the provisions being consumed, notwithstanding it had
two miles’ rapidity, may be navigable for a considerable distance
further when the high water covers the rocks, provided no cataracts
of consequence oppose the course. Therefore he gives thirty hours
for the southern direction of the river before he makes an arm go
to the east. We could only have settled how far the river was
navigated, by proceeding on our course, if that had been possible
at the time.</p>

<p>However, there has never been any talk of these thirty hours;
and Arnaud has, of his own will, reduced the distance of thirty
days, repeatedly given to us by the king of Bari and his
attendants, as the time required for navigating the different arms,
in order to pretend that he was <em>closer</em> to the sources. But
the division of time into <em>hours</em> must be known on the White
Nile first, before such a flippant substitution can take place. It
seemed also incredible to me that Anjan should be a month distant,
but thirty days were plainly represented<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_347_v2">[347]</span> to us. If we reckon only eight hours to
be a day’s journey, the distance would be <em>eight</em> degrees,
half of which we should have to deduct naturally for local
impediments, to bring the geographical position of Anjan under the
equator. That we had not misunderstood the word “month” was proved
besides by Làkono clenching his fist three times, to denote thirty
days, and also by the expression that after <em>two months</em>
(therefore at the end of March or beginning of April) the rains
commenced. Lastly, the circumstance that several other tribes were
said to dwell on the shores towards the south, bespeaks a
considerable distance. It is, however, still a question, whether
the country of Berri is ten or thirty days’ journey off. Làkono, in
whose eyes the copper so abundant there has an extraordinary value,
might have feared, at the commencement of our acquaintance, that we
wanted to spoil his trade with Berri, and to enrich ourselves with
its treasures: from this supposition he increased the distance
threefold.</p>

<p>But when Arnaud arbitrarily reduces that first statement to
fifteen days’ journey, it shews a thoughtless disposition; for he
was not only present at the conversation with the king, but we have
spoken of it among ourselves. He has, therefore, either entirely
forgotten it, and his recollection has not been assisted by any
notes written down at the time, which is quite necessary in these
countries, notwithstanding the illness to which we are constantly
liable; or he wanted to give a greater air of probability to his
account by fiction, namely, by substituting thirty hours for thirty
days.</p>

<p>When I find marked on his map above Bari, “Country of the
Pulunchs,” it recalls clearly to my recollection how he believed
every thing without investigation, and noted down what Thibaut told
him. I was sitting one day sketching on the rocks of the island:
some natives stood by, who understood very well what I was doing,
and I still see them—how<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_348_v2">[348]</span> they extended their arms horizontally,
and made undulating movements, which was meant to denote a
continuation of the mountains lying before us to the south, and
then mentioning several names, held up their hands together, and by
the thumb indicated to me that there was <em>one</em> mountain
exceeding all the others in height, whilst they looked
contemptuously at the other chain of mountains. At the same time
they bawled in my ears, because I did not speak, and still less
could answer, so that I was nearly deaf, under which affliction
they probably thought I was labouring. I got up and went down to
the shore, where I saw Thibaut standing. He stretched his hand
towards the south, with an enquiring look, and the people said
“Pulunch,” whereupon he burst out into an Homeric laugh, and said,
“that is something for Arnaud.” The latter has made a country out
of this observation, and perhaps with justice.</p>

<p>With regard to the time of the winds and rains in Central
Africa, I have tried several times, but find myself incapable of
explaining these magnificent natural phenomena. It appears certain,
that the monsoons of the Indian, the trade-winds of the Atlantic
Oceans, and the north winds from the Mediterranean, are subject to
different natural laws in the interior of Africa, where it is
comparatively cooler than on the sea-shore; for the winds were
never constant during our course: they changed continually from
side to side, and all the observations and calculations of our
sailors, accurate as they are in other places, failed in
ascertaining the tide and quarters of the moon. As to the mutual
swelling of the two Niles near Khartùm (called by the Turks
Khàrdùm), the sources have nothing to do with the first rising of
the water, but the succeeding ones give a quantity of water to the
countries subject to tropical rains, together with their gohrs and
tributaries, among which the Sobàt is the most<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_349_v2">[349]</span> considerable for the White Stream.
This mass of water immediately becomes imperceptibly level,
excepting certain disproportions, with the head of Sennaar,
conformably to hydrostatic laws.</p>

<p>It would be an idle attempt to endeavour to speak out clearer
and more strikingly touching the formation of the soil of Central
Africa; for a master like Professor Carl Ritter has already done
this in his “Glance at the Source-territory of the Nile.” In order
to set aside many preconceived opinions, and again to give the true
imprint of my own views, I do not hesitate to annex the report of
Dr. Girard, whom I have several times mentioned, and which was
contained in the above instructive little work, being partly
founded upon my geognostical collection; because this learned young
man has discovered and ascertained, with acuteness rarely to be
found, the quality of the soil in Africa, so far as I am able to
judge from my expedition. He says:—“There are three great mountain
chains in the eastern part of Central Africa, one extending to the
east, the other to the South, and the third to the West. The
eastern one surrounds the large Tzana-lake, and contains the
sources of the Tacazze and the Blue Nile, and ascends easterly from
the latter to a height of more than 10,000 feet. The southern and
south westerly, respecting the elevation of which nothing is known,
forms the water-shed between the tributaries of the Nile and the
territory of the streams flowing westerly, and is that region
formerly called the Mountains of the Moon. Lastly, the
north-westerly, the centre of which is in the Jebel Marra, from
which some tributaries wind towards the south, to the
Bah’r-el-Abiad; but the most of these subordinate streams flow
towards the west, the centre of Africa. Between the eastern and
southern mountain-stock, there is another chain of high mountains,
not extensive but lofty, which, forming the westerly part
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350_v2">[350]</span> Enarea,
appears to spread to the kingdom of Bari, and attains in Enarea a
height of more than 7000 feet.<a id="FNanchor_8v2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_8v2" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>“A marsh-land extends to the south of this mountain, and the
Goshcop flows into it: if it be permitted to carry our surmises so
far, we should say that not any high mountains are to be expected
further to the south, for coffee and cotton are cultivated on the
other side of the Goshcop-valley, because we conceive that there is
a salt-lake, and, lastly, a land producing gold. The former may be
considered to lie on a dry table-land, the latter on a low plain,
wherein the auriferous loam and sand may be deposited.</p>

<p>“A similar auriferous foreland seems to extend in the centre of
these regions, between the highlands of Enarea and Bari, to the
upper course of the Bah’r-el-Abiad, and the mountains of Kordofàn,
Sennaar, and Fàzogl.<a id="FNanchor_9v2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_9v2" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It is a country which is
inhabited partly by negroes pursuing agriculture. Another part
consists of wide plains, covered with high grasses, wherein many
elephants pasture, and which is bounded on the north by a girdle,
thirty miles in breadth, of a ground containing gold-sand. These
are the plains through which the Sobàt (written in French Saubat)
flows with its <em>tributaries</em> to the Bah’r-el-Abiad.<a id=
"FNanchor_10v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_10v2" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> The specimens from the shores of the Sobàt are
composed partly of a micaceous sand, of a brown black ochrous clay,
of chalky sand, and partly of a conglomerate, which is baked
together and composed of small fragments of limestone. The sand,
when it is pure, consists of several little yellowish<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_351_v2">[351]</span> grains of quartz, a small
portion of reddish feldspar, some brown iron-stones, tombac, brown
mica, and little grains of a black mineral, the nature of which
cannot be accurately ascertained. This composition denotes that the
sand derives its origin from a mica slate, and gneiss chain of
mountains, not very distant; for if the sand were far from the
mountains from whence it sprang, it would not contain coloured
mica. The sand of the shore of the Bah’r-el-Abiad, in the kingdom
of Bari, is perfectly similar to this sand, only somewhat coarser
in grain, and, moreover, merely attaining to the size of millet. It
contains principally quartz, then the same brown mica, only in a
larger quantity than in the preceding sand, and, in addition,
several more of those black grains, proving that there is
hornblende here. This comes probably from syenite and diorite
masses, as they are frequently seen in gneiss and mica-slate
mountains. They might, however, be of volcanic origin, for they
contain, in great abundance, the lava of the Jebel Defafaungh
(written in French Tefafon) on the north boundary of the said
plain. The mountain is clearly an extinct volcano. It rises
probably from a basaltic plateau, for basalt with olivine and
pyroxene are seen in it, and red-brown porous lava, with large
rounded hornblende crystals and dark-grey tophus, formed of clear
little porous fragments of lava and fine ashes, seem to cover its
declivity. The tophus, as well as the lava, does not contain any
vitreous feldspar, nor is any pumice-stone observable among them,
but all the products of the volcano shew that it is a converted
basalt.</p>

<p>“The volcanic activity appears not to have extended far, and is
only discovered on the northern margin of this cauldron, which was
probably, at one time, a large sweet-water basin, for the stones of
Sennaar in the north, those of Fazògl and Bertat in the east, of
the country of Bari in the south, and of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_352_v2">[352]</span> Kordofàn and Jebel Tira in the west, are
of a different nature.</p>

<p>“The collections in this city are derived partly from M. Werne,
who made them in the expedition sent by the Basha of Egypt in the
year 1840, and partly are owing to the scientific liberality of M.
Russegger; and they afford sufficient information with respect to
the general geognostic relations of these scarcely discovered
mountains.</p>

<p>“The chain of the Mountains of the Moon consists, according to
the several specimens, of gneiss and mica-slate. One of these
specimens, was taken from the most southerly point that the
expedition reached, and indeed, ‘from the cataracts in the land of
Bari;’ that is to say, from the rock which prevented the expedition
from penetrating further into the country. It is gneiss, composed
of white feldspar, and much black mica, and mica-slate; the friable
and exceedingly granulous quartz does not contain feldspar, but
small scaly black mica. There is found, moreover, in the valley of
Berri, magnet iron-stone, which, however, does not seem to be
commonly known; for it has been collected to the amount of several
pounds weight, as being merely sand, without any other particles of
stone.<a id="FNanchor_11v2"></a><a href="#Footnote_11v2" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>“The magnet-iron displays also, in several places, brittle
iron-ore, and reminds me of similar occurrences in the large
mica-slate mountain-chain of the Brazils.</p>

<p>“We do not possess, unfortunately, any specimens from the high
mountains of Enarea, but the stones of the lands of Bertat,
Sennaar, and Fazògl, are well known through<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_353_v2">[353]</span> M. Russegger’s excellent collection.
There are granite and gneiss mountains in the land of Bertat, and
in the southern part of Fazògl; chlorite slate (probably the stone
bringing gold here) follows this chain towards the north, together
with mica-slate; and lastly, in Sennaar, there is also clay-slate.
In the latter, which is very much changed in some places, veins of
granite and quartz are at the top, so that here also, as in many
other points, the clay-slate appears the more ancient, the granite
the more modern stone. Granite is met with likewise on the Bah’r el
Abiad, in the Jebel Njemati (Iemati), being partly of pink
feldspar, white albin, grey quartz and black mica, and partly
composed without albin, and only of dark red feldspar, white
quartz, and black mica.</p>

<p>“Similar species of rocks are found in Kordofàn, viz., granite,
gneiss, and mica-slate. However, diorite makes its appearance
towards the south, consisting of white feldspar, green and black
hornblende, and a little volcanic sand. On the island of Tira there
is also chlorite slate. But the most remarkable thing is the
appearance of clinkstone or phonolite, found in Koldadschi (written
also Kodalgi and Koldagi), in Russegger’s collection.</p>

<p>“This circumstance is conclusive of a considerable development
of basaltic stones in these regions, though it does not denote
volcanic phenomena; for phonolite, with us, only appears in those
basaltic mountain-groups where there has not been any eruption of
volcanoes.</p>

<p>“A sandstone and hornstone formation, probably belonging to the
latter tertiary rocks, is situated before the mountain-chain of
Kordofàn and Sennaar, to which Mount Mandera, which consists of
syenite, is united in the east. It forms the Jebel Mussa, specimens
from which have been given both by Russegger and Werne.</p>

<p>“We wind up the geognostical picture of these countries
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354_v2">[354]</span> saying that
we find granite, gneiss, and mica-slate generally spread, with
which clay-slate, chlorite-slate, and diorite present themselves,
all of the earlier formation,—new stones of basalt, phonolites, and
volcanoes, springing from the tertiary epoch, join on immediately
to the others. The limestone conglomerates, found in the Sobàt,
have perhaps their origin in chalk lime-stone, to which they belong
apparently, judging from external appearances; and if this should
be the case, the geognostical relations of the eastern part of
central Africa are closely allied to those of Palestine, Syria, and
Asia Minor.”</p>
